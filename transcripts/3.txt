This video, the third in the getting
0:04
started series, will cover how to create
0:06
a sketch in Fusion.
0:09
Topics covered include creating a
0:11
component,
0:13
the line command, constraints,
0:17
adding dimensions,
0:19
and auto constrain.
0:22
In Fusion, it's always good practice to
0:24
create everything as components.
0:27
This helps with the organization of your
0:29
design and simplifies the timeline.
0:32
We will begin by making a component.
0:36
Navigate to the create menu and choose
0:38
new component.
0:42
In the dialogue box, enter spool as the
0:45
name and click okay.
0:48
The newly created spool component will
0:51
then appear in the structure browser
0:53
over on the left side.
0:56
To begin a sketch, click the create
0:58
sketch icon within the create menu and
1:02
choose the front plane. For plane
1:05
orientation, reference the cube located
1:08
in the upper right corner of the
1:09
viewport.
1:11
The viewport's blue, red, and green
1:14
lines correspond to the blue, red, and
1:17
green lines on the cube.
1:20
Having selected the front plane, we have
1:22
now entered the sketch environment.
1:25
This is indicated by the appearance of
1:27
the sketch menu and the associated
1:30
commands at the top of the interface
1:32
along with the sketch pallet on your
1:34
screen.
1:36
To confirm that we're working in
1:37
millimeters, navigate to the document
1:40
settings in the browser panel on the
1:42
left. If necessary, switch to millime by
1:46
clicking the change active units icon
1:50
and select millime for the length
1:52
setting.
1:54
We are going to create the side profile
1:56
of the spool and revolve it around a
1:58
central axis to create a 3D
2:00
representation of the spool.
2:03
Let's start by drawing the vertical
2:05
axis.
2:07
Select the line command from the create
2:10
menu. Then click on the 0 0 point on the
2:13
screen.
2:16
move up vertically some distance and
2:18
make sure the line snaps exactly
2:20
vertical and then click the end point of
2:23
the line. We're not going to type in a
2:26
distance or an angle at this time. When
2:29
complete, press the escape key to get
2:31
out of the line command.
2:34
To change the line to a center line,
2:37
first click on the line to pre-select
2:39
it. It will turn blue, indicating that
2:42
it is selected.
2:44
Then in the sketch palette, choose the
2:47
center line line type.
2:50
Begin sketching the spool's basic
2:52
outline using the line tool.
2:56
Refer to the image in exhibit one of the
2:58
accompanying documentation for this
3:00
video as a guide.
3:03
At this initial stage, focus on
3:06
capturing the overall shape and do not
3:08
be too concerned with precise dimensions
3:11
or perfectly horizontal or vertical
3:13
lines. These aspects will be refined in
3:16
subsequent steps.
3:20
As you sketch in Fusion, you'll see
3:23
icons appearing next to the lines. These
3:26
are constraints which ensure your sketch
3:28
behaves predictably. For instance,
3:31
constraints can force lines to remain
3:34
horizontal, vertical, or perpendicular.
3:38
After creating the sketch, I notice an
3:40
issue. One of my lines isn't perfectly
3:43
vertical. To correct this, I can use the
3:47
horizontal vertical constraint found in
3:49
the constraint menu.
3:52
Selecting this constraint and then the
3:54
line will force it to become vertical.
3:58
Additionally, I want the bottom edge of
4:00
the spool to be horizontal with the
4:03
origin point. Therefore, I will apply a
4:06
horizontal constraint to both the corner
4:08
of the spool and the 000 point.
4:12
We can add a collinear constraint to
4:15
make the two outside edges stay in line
4:18
with each other.
4:20
It is better to use constraints than to
4:23
have two dimensions.
4:25
That way, if you want to change the
4:27
outside diameter of the spool, you only
4:29
have to edit one dimension instead of
4:32
two.
4:33
Refer to exhibit two. Unconstrained
4:37
sketch geometry is displayed in cyan.
4:40
Once fully defined, these lines turn
4:43
black. Fully constraining your sketch is
4:46
recommended to prevent unexpected
4:48
changes downstream.
4:50
Dimensions can be added to further
4:52
constrain this sketch. To add a
4:55
dimension, select the dimension command
4:58
within the create menu. Click the outer
5:01
vertical edge. Move your mouse and click
5:04
again to place the dimension. The blue
5:08
highlighted text indicates that it's
5:10
ready for input.
5:12
Enter 15 and press enter to set the edge
5:16
height to 15 mm.
5:19
As you add dimensions, your sketch lines
5:22
might shift as the dimensions change
5:24
their length. If this happens, simply
5:27
click and drag them to put them back
5:29
into their desired position.
5:34
Dimensioning can also be done between
5:36
points instead of lines. Simply select
5:40
the first point followed by the second,
5:43
then position the dimension and then
5:46
input the desired value. Continue
5:49
adding all of the vertical dimensions.
5:53
Refer to exhibit 3.
5:59
To create an angular dimension, simply
6:02
select the two lines. The dimension will
6:05
automatically be applied as an angle.
6:09
Because we created a center line to
6:11
start out with, we can create diameter
6:13
dimensions automatically by selecting
6:16
the center line first and then a
6:18
vertical edge and then place the
6:21
dimension and enter its value.
6:24
Notice that the value has a diameter
6:26
symbol next to it. This is very handy so
6:30
you don't have to do all the
6:31
mathematical calculations yourself.
6:34
Continue
6:36
adding the diameter dimensions and the
6:38
other horizontal dimensions.
6:41
Notice as we're adding these dimensions
6:43
that the cyan lines are turning black,
6:46
signifying that they are now becoming
6:48
fully constrained.
6:50
Refer to exhibit 4.
6:56
After adding dimensions, a scan line
6:58
remains and the pencil icon next to our
7:01
sketch in the spool component sketches
7:03
folder indicates that it's not fully
7:06
constrained.
7:08
We aim for a lock icon instead.
7:12
Let's use auto constrain to identify the
7:14
missing constraints.
7:17
Fusion added two dimensions,
7:20
one for the top recess and another for
7:23
the initial center line axis.
7:27
Click okay and modify these new
7:29
dimensions to 4 mm and 40 mm
7:33
respectively.
7:35
Now you can see the lock symbol next to
7:37
our sketch signifying a fully
7:39
constrained sketch. The only way this
7:42
sketch can change is if we physically
7:45
change the dimensions.
7:47
Also notice that we have kept the sketch
7:49
fairly simple. We haven't added any
7:52
fillets or chamfers. We will do that on
7:55
the 3D model. It is always a good idea
7:58
to keep your sketches as simple as
8:00
possible. We are now done with our
8:02
sketch. So we can click on finish sketch
8:05
in the main menu or in the sketch
8:07
palette.
8:09
In the next video, we will use our
8:11
sketch to create a 3D model.
