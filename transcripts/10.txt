In this video, the 10th in the getting
0:02
started series, we will learn about the
0:04
form command to create the handle grip
0:07
and learn some additional functionality
0:09
such as creating forms,
0:12
using symmetry,
0:15
fill hole, inserting edges,
0:18
editing forms, and extend to adjacent
0:22
faces.
0:25
The handle grip on our fishing reel has
0:27
more of an organic shape to it. And this
0:30
is where the form command is really
0:32
powerful. Instead of creating complex
0:35
surfaces or lofts, it's more like
0:38
modeling with clay.
0:40
To begin, click the plus icon at the top
0:44
to create a new design.
0:46
From the create menu, choose create
0:49
form.
0:51
This will switch the screen to the form
0:53
environment and you will notice purple
0:55
form commands in the menu.
0:59
From the create menu, select cylinder
1:02
and then select the side plane in the
1:05
viewport.
1:07
Click at the 0 0 mark to start the
1:09
cylinder. Move your cursor then click
1:12
again.
1:14
A cylindrical tube will appear along
1:17
with the cylinder dialogue box.
1:20
In the dialogue box, enter 12 for the
1:23
diameter and 20 for the height.
1:28
The number of faces created around the
1:30
diameter is determined by the diameter
1:32
faces setting, while the height faces
1:35
setting dictates how many faces define
1:38
the height. We will keep these at their
1:41
default values.
1:43
It's always best practice to use the
1:45
fewest possible faces to achieve the
1:47
smoothest result. To ensure the grip has
1:51
symmetry, change the symmetry option
1:53
from none to mirror and enable the
1:57
length symmetry.
2:00
Green lines will appear along the
2:02
length, indicating that any actions
2:04
performed above these lines will be
2:07
mirrored below them.
2:09
Refer to exhibit one.
2:12
To prevent the grip from being hollow,
2:14
we'll need to patch the cylinder's ends.
2:18
First, doubleclick the circular edge at
2:21
the cylinder's end to select the entire
2:24
edge loop.
2:26
Next, go to the modify menu and choose
2:29
fill hole.
2:33
In the dialogue box, select the fill
2:36
hole mode to fill star.
2:40
You can toggle through the other modes
2:42
to preview them, but return to fill star
2:45
and click okay.
2:49
Refer to exhibit two.
2:52
Repeat the same process on the edge loop
2:54
on the other side of the cylinder, but
2:56
this time, right mouse click after
2:58
selecting the edge loop, and you will
3:00
notice the fill hole command in the
3:02
right mouse click menu.
3:05
The form tool aims for smooth G2
3:08
continuous surfaces which explains the
3:11
gentle curve from the height edge to the
3:13
end face. To achieve a tighter fillet
3:17
curve, an additional edge needs to be
3:19
inserted.
3:21
From the modify menu, select insert
3:24
edge.
3:26
Then doubleclick the height edge to
3:28
select the whole edge loop.
3:32
A green preview edge will appear showing
3:34
which side the inserted edge will be
3:36
created.
3:38
Press okay. And notice how the rounded
3:41
edge is tighter now compared to the
3:43
other end of the cylinder.
3:46
To further tighten the radius, we need
3:48
to slide the edge to the left.
3:52
Doubleclick the edge loop. Then
3:54
rightclick and select slide edge.
4:00
Drag the slider until the green edge
4:02
preview moves to the left and then enter
4:05
0.4 in the location field and press
4:09
okay.
4:11
This will make the left face flatter and
4:14
reduces the radius.
4:17
Refer to exhibit 3.
4:20
Now we want to squish the cylinder down
4:22
a little bit to make it less round. To
4:25
do this, double click on a face to
4:27
select all of the faces of the part.
4:31
Right mouse click and select edit form
4:34
from the marking menu.
4:37
You will see a triad appear with many
4:40
icons to select from. They allow you to
4:43
move, rotate, and scale.
4:46
You can control which transform mode you
4:49
want to use by selecting it from the
4:51
dialogue menu.
4:53
In this case, let's select the scale
4:56
transform and you will notice many of
4:58
the icons disappear.
5:02
Select the horizontal scale bar in the
5:05
XZ plane and drag it down to scale the
5:08
whole model down in that direction.
5:12
Type in 0.7 for the scale factor and
5:15
press okay.
5:17
To make the grip easier to grip onto, we
5:20
want to create an indentation for the
5:22
fingers to grab onto.
5:26
Select the top two edges using your
5:28
control key on a PC or the command key
5:31
on a Mac and then rightclick and select
5:34
edit form.
5:37
You will notice the triad still shows
5:39
the scale transform.
5:42
Click on the translation option in the
5:44
transform mode and drag the up arrow
5:47
downward 3 mm.
5:53
Now select just the right middle edge
5:56
and drag it down another 1 mm and press
5:59
okay.
6:01
Refer to exhibit 4.
6:05
Due to the mirror symmetry we previously
6:07
enabled, any modifications made to the
6:10
top of the part are also reflected on
6:12
the bottom.
6:14
Rotate the model to view the back edge
6:16
and select the middle right green edge.
6:21
Edit the form and translate the edge
6:24
outward 3 mm to create a slight bulge
6:28
and press okay.
6:31
We can now see that the grip is shaped
6:34
better for grabbing with your fingers
6:35
while winding the reel.
6:38
Refer to exhibit five.
6:41
We are done shaping the form, but we
6:43
need to add some geometry to the end of
6:45
the grip. Click on finish form to return
6:49
back to the regular modeling commands.
6:53
Turn on the origin and create a sketch
6:55
on the side plane of the origin.
7:01
Draw a 6 mm circle at the origin.
7:07
Offset the circle 2 mm inward and then
7:10
click finish sketch.
7:14
Select the profile, right click and
7:17
select extrude from the menu.
7:21
Change the extent type to to object and
7:25
select one of the faces on the end of
7:27
the grip.
7:29
An error message appears saying that the
7:32
extrude cannot be completed.
7:35
This is because the surface is curved
7:37
and we need the extrude to extend to all
7:39
of the adjacent faces of the single face
7:42
that we had selected.
7:45
Pick on the two adjacent faces option in
7:48
the dialogue and the extrude will now
7:50
work correctly.
7:53
Refer to exhibit six.
7:56
Click on the hole command from the main
7:58
menu and then click somewhere on the
8:00
flat face of the standoff on the grip.
8:05
Turn off the origin and then drag the
8:08
blue dot to the white dot in the center
8:11
of the circle and the hole will snap
8:14
into place.
8:16
Change the hole tap type option to
8:19
tapped in the dialogue and set the size
8:22
to 2 mm
8:24
and the length to 6 mm.
8:28
This will create a hole the correct
8:30
diameter for a tapped 2 mm bolt.
8:34
Press okay.
8:36
Refer to exhibit 7.
8:39
We want to change the appearance of the
8:41
grip to be the same as the handle. So go
8:44
to the modify menu and then pick
8:46
appearance.
8:48
In the search window, type in powder
8:52
coat black and it will filter out all of
8:55
the other appearances and only show the
8:58
materials called powder coat black.
9:02
Drag the appearance onto the grip.
9:06
Click the save icon and save the file as
9:10
handle grip.
9:15
In the next video, we will learn how to
9:17
assemble our components together.
