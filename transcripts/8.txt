In this video, the eighth in the getting
0:03
started series, we will be using the
0:05
sweep command to create the bale arm
0:07
wire and learn some additional
0:10
functionality such as construction
0:13
geometry
0:14
projections,
0:16
3D sketching, and plane along a path.
0:21
Building on our previous work, we will
0:23
now utilize the existing components to
0:25
design the bale arm wire.
0:28
Start by creating a component and naming
0:31
it bale arm wire.
0:34
To define our sketch plane, we'll first
0:37
create some construction geometry.
0:40
This will allow us to create a sketch
0:42
through the center of the cylinder in
0:44
the bail arm.
0:46
In the construct menu, select axis
0:50
through cylinder
0:52
and select the cylindrical face of the
0:54
bail arm.
0:57
A cyan axis line now runs through the
1:00
axis of that cylinder.
1:02
Let's repeat that command and also
1:05
select the cylinder in the line roller.
1:10
Refer to exhibit one.
1:14
In the construct menu, choose plane at
1:18
an angle.
1:20
Then select the axis line in the bail
1:23
arm.
1:24
This will generate a construction plane
1:27
tangent to the axis line.
1:30
While the plane's angle around the axis
1:32
can be adjusted, it should remain at 0°
1:36
in this instance.
1:38
Refer to exhibit 2.
1:41
Right click on the construction plane
1:43
and select create sketch.
1:47
To ensure precise placement of our
1:49
sketch lines, we need to project
1:52
geometry onto the sketch.
1:55
From the create menu, choose project
1:58
include
2:00
and then project.
2:04
Rotate the view to look inside the bale
2:06
arm cylinder.
2:09
Select the cylindrical face and press
2:11
okay.
2:14
This will project the cylinder's 2D
2:16
outline onto the sketch.
2:20
Navigate to create project include
2:24
include 3D geometry.
2:28
Select the cylindrical face within the
2:30
line roller.
2:32
This action projects the cylinder's 3D
2:35
edges into 3D space rather than
2:39
projecting them flat onto the sketch
2:41
plane.
2:42
Finally, go to create
2:46
project include
2:48
intersect
2:50
and select the angled axis line.
2:55
This creates a point where the axis line
2:58
intersects with the sketch plane.
3:01
We just used three different projection
3:04
types to gather information from our
3:06
existing models to help us design the
3:09
bail arm wire.
3:11
Refer to exhibit 3.
3:14
Click on the top plane of the view cube
3:16
to look at the sketch from the top.
3:20
Use the line command to draw a line from
3:23
the middle of the back projected line of
3:25
the cylinder in the bail arm 22 mm
3:29
vertically.
3:32
Refer to exhibit 4.
3:35
Start by drawing another line at a
3:37
slight angle from the intersection point
3:40
near the line roller.
3:43
Then horizontally constrain the two
3:46
vertical points.
3:50
Use the P shortcut key to access the
3:54
project command.
3:57
Change the selection filter to bodies.
4:01
Select the line roller body and press
4:04
okay.
4:07
This action will project a silhouette of
4:09
the entire body onto the sketch.
4:12
Finally, use the parallel constraint to
4:16
align the newly drawn line with the edge
4:19
of the line roller.
4:22
Refer to exhibit five. Create a
4:26
threepoint arc using the two existing
4:28
end points and an additional point
4:31
located above them.
4:34
Next, initiate the dimension command.
4:39
Right click and choose pick circle arc
4:42
tangent.
4:45
Select the newly created arc and then
4:48
the projected line that the 22 mm
4:51
dimension refers to.
4:54
Then place the dimension and input 37 mm
4:57
for the distance.
5:00
To connect our sketch to the line
5:02
roller, we'll create a short segment
5:04
using the 3D sketching capabilities.
5:08
From the sketch pallet, select 3D
5:10
sketch, then choose the line tool from
5:14
the create menu.
5:18
Start by clicking on the point where the
5:20
axis intersects the sketch plane.
5:23
A 3D sketch triad will appear at this
5:26
point.
5:28
The XY plane is initially highlighted,
5:31
but you'll need to change this to the XZ
5:33
plane or the front plane.
5:37
Click on the XZ plane within the triad.
5:41
The grid will rotate vertically and the
5:44
XZ plane will be highlighted.
5:48
This process allows you to control which
5:50
plane you sketch and snap to.
5:54
As you rotate the view, you'll notice
5:57
that the cylinder's point doesn't lie on
5:59
this plane, which is why we projected
6:02
the geometry to snap to it.
6:06
Move your cursor to the center point of
6:08
the projected cylinder on the line
6:10
roller.
6:12
Ensure that the cursor changes to a
6:15
circle indicating that it has snapped to
6:17
the point and then click
6:21
to complete the line. Click the check
6:24
box next to the triad.
6:27
Finally, turn off 3D sketch in the
6:30
sketch pallet as this option is not
6:32
needed all the time.
6:35
Refer to exhibit six.
6:39
Use the fill it command to fill it the
6:41
right side of the ark 12 mm.
6:50
Fill at the left side of the ark 20 mm
6:54
and then fill at the small corner 2 mm
6:59
and finish the sketch.
7:04
To simplify the next few steps,
7:06
deactivate the bail, bail arms, and real
7:11
body components.
7:14
Our next step involves using the sweep
7:16
command to sweep a profile along the
7:19
recently created path.
7:22
But before we proceed, we must create
7:24
the profile for the sweep and ensure
7:27
that it's positioned on the path.
7:30
In the construct menu, select plane
7:33
along path and click somewhere along the
7:36
path.
7:40
Notice that you can drag the plane
7:41
anywhere along the path. However, we
7:44
want to drag it to the very beginning at
7:47
a distance of zero and then press okay.
7:52
Right click on the plane and choose
7:54
create sketch to create a sketch on that
7:57
plane.
7:59
Draw a 1.65 diameter circle using the
8:03
end point of the path as the center
8:06
point for the circle.
8:08
Refer to exhibit 7.
8:11
To initiate the sweep command, access
8:14
the create menu and select sweep, which
8:17
will open the sweep dialogue.
8:21
First, choose the circle to serve as the
8:23
profile.
8:26
Next, click the select button adjacent
8:29
to the path and then select the desired
8:32
path within the viewport.
8:35
Due to the chain selection option being
8:38
enabled, all tangentially connected
8:40
segments of the path will be
8:42
automatically selected as a continuous
8:45
chain.
8:47
A circle is a pretty straightforward
8:49
shape to sweep. Let's complicate things
8:52
by sweeping a more intricate profile.
8:56
Edit the final sketch in the timeline.
8:59
Change the circle to construction
9:01
geometry
9:03
and then create a circumscribed polygon
9:06
that snaps to the construction circles
9:09
radius.
9:11
Then click finish sketch.
9:16
Refer to exhibit 8.
9:20
The sweep feature in the timeline will
9:22
turn yellow because the profile it used
9:24
for the original sweep has been
9:26
converted to construction geometry.
9:29
To update the sweep, edit the sweep
9:32
feature in the timeline.
9:35
Select the hexagon profile
9:38
and then press okay.
9:42
Notice how the hexagon profile is now
9:44
being swept along the path.
9:48
From the main menu, click the down arrow
9:50
next to the undo icon.
9:53
Then from the undo tree, select undoedit
9:58
sketch, which is approximately five
10:00
steps down.
10:03
A quick way to turn all of our
10:05
components back on is to rightclick on
10:08
the top level and select show all
10:11
components.
10:15
Activate the top level component to ungo
10:18
all of the other components.
10:22
Press the save icon to save the
10:24
assembly.
10:27
In the next video, we will use the loft
10:30
command to create the handle.
