In this video, the 13th in the getting
0:03
started series, we will learn about
0:05
inspecting your design and learn some
0:07
additional functionality such as
0:10
measure, interference,
0:13
section analysis,
0:15
center of mass, and mass properties.
0:20
The inspect menu in Fusion offers
0:22
various tools for model inspection
0:24
during the design process.
0:27
These tools allow you to measure
0:29
distances, check for interferences,
0:32
section through assemblies to assess
0:34
form, fit, and function, and calculate
0:37
total weight.
0:40
With the fishing reel assembly open, we
0:42
want to take some measurements.
0:45
Click on the measure icon above the
0:47
inspect menu, then click on the large
0:50
cylindrical face of the spool.
0:53
The measure dialogue shows the radius
0:56
and the diameter of the face that you
0:58
selected.
1:00
Click on the clear selection arrow to
1:03
start a new measurement.
1:05
Refer to exhibit one.
1:09
If we wanted to find out the width of
1:11
the main body of the reel, we can select
1:13
the two side faces and it will show the
1:16
distance of 16 mm between the two faces.
1:21
Clear the selection. and click on the
1:23
fillet radius of the spool.
1:26
The measure command returns the radius
1:28
of the fillet.
1:31
Another way to clear the selection is to
1:33
just click out in the viewport.
1:36
Now click on the cylindrical surface of
1:39
one of the holes in the spool. Then
1:42
click on the bottom edge of the spool.
1:44
The measure dialogue will show the
1:46
radius and the diameter of the hole
1:49
along with the shortest distance between
1:51
the hole and the edge of the spool.
1:54
Refer to exhibit two.
1:57
If we want to get the measurement from
1:59
the center of the hole to the bottom
2:00
edge, we will need to turn on the show
2:03
snap points option in the dialogue.
2:08
Clear the selection and hover over the
2:11
cylindrical face of the hole and click.
2:14
It will snap to the center point of the
2:16
hole.
2:18
Now select the bottom edge and the
2:21
result will show a distance of 3 mm.
2:26
Refer to exhibit 3.
2:31
This method also allows for measuring
2:33
curved surfaces.
2:35
First, clear the current selection.
2:39
Then, hover over the top curved edge of
2:42
the tensioner and select its midpoint
2:44
marker.
2:47
Pan down to the bottom of the reel and
2:50
select its bottom middle point.
2:54
A direct measurement line will appear
2:56
between these two points.
3:01
Finally, click on the XYZ delta1 icon to
3:06
display the Z delta distance, which is a
3:09
straight vertical measurement from the
3:11
bottom point to the top plane of the top
3:15
point.
3:17
Refer to exhibit 4.
3:21
In Fusion, a handy trick for quick
3:23
measurements is to simply click on a
3:26
single entity.
3:28
The measurement will then appear in the
3:30
bottom right corner of your screen.
3:33
For instance, clicking on a fillet will
3:35
display its radius
3:38
and clicking on an edge will show its
3:40
length.
3:42
To measure distances between faces or
3:44
edges, however, you'll need to utilize
3:46
the dedicated measure command.
3:50
Another helpful tool for inspection is
3:53
the interference tool, which highlights
3:56
overlapping or interfering parts.
3:59
To use it, select interference from the
4:03
inspect menu.
4:05
Then drag a crossing window from right
4:09
to left over the handle and the handle
4:12
grip.
4:15
Finally, click the compute icon in the
4:18
dialogue box.
4:22
A table displays two groups with
4:24
differing volume results.
4:27
The larger volume highlights a screw
4:29
with a greater diameter than the hole in
4:31
the handle grip, requiring resolution.
4:36
The other volume highlights a clashing
4:38
filleted edge of the screw with the
4:41
sharp edge of the handle's hole, also
4:44
needing resolution for a tight fit
4:46
against the handle's flat face.
4:49
Click okay to close the table. Refer to
4:53
exhibit 5.
4:57
Double click on the screw in the
4:59
viewport and notice it displays the name
5:01
in the bottom of the screen. We can see
5:04
that it's an M3x16
5:07
screw.
5:09
Now click the edit and place icon next
5:13
to the handle grip component in the
5:15
browser.
5:17
A blue border will appear around the
5:19
viewport signifying that we are in the
5:22
edit and place environment.
5:25
Edit the whole feature in the timeline
5:28
and change the size to 3 mm
5:32
and the depth to 9 mm
5:35
and press okay.
5:39
Then click on finish edit in place at
5:43
the top of the viewport to accept the
5:45
changes to the model.
5:47
Refer to exhibit six.
5:51
Turn off the fastener
5:54
and then click the edit in place icon
5:56
next to handle start.
6:01
Add a 0.3 mm chamfer to the edge of the
6:05
hole going through the handle.
6:09
Press okay and then finish edit in
6:12
place.
6:16
You will get a warning that the screw
6:18
has lost reference with the handle since
6:20
we changed the edge it was originally
6:22
associated with.
6:25
Edit the fastener feature in the
6:26
timeline and select the new edge to
6:30
reassociate it.
6:32
Press okay and notice that the warnings
6:35
have been resolved.
6:38
Refer to exhibit seven.
6:43
After rerunning the interference check,
6:46
only one group now shows interference
6:48
between the handle and the handle grip.
6:51
We resolved the previous small
6:53
interference by adding a chamfer to the
6:55
handle.
6:57
The remaining interference in the handle
6:59
grip is expected and valid as the hole
7:02
is drilled smaller for tapping which is
7:05
typical for a tapped hole size.
7:08
The interference inspection successfully
7:11
resolved the issues with the handle and
7:13
the grip.
7:17
The section analysis command found in
7:20
the inspect menu is another useful tool
7:23
for identifying potential issues.
7:26
After selecting the command, click on
7:29
the front flat face of the reel to view
7:32
a cross-section of the assembly.
7:36
The blue arrow allows you to drag and
7:38
slice through your design.
7:43
Clicking on a cylindrical object will
7:45
align the section plane with the center
7:47
of that cylinder.
7:50
You can also customize the section color
7:54
or toggle the hatch visibility.
8:00
Press okay to confirm the section view.
8:04
Refer to exhibit 8.
8:08
Initiate another section analysis.
8:11
Selecting the top origin plane.
8:16
Drag the blue arrow entirely above the
8:19
assembly. Then snap it to the center of
8:22
the line roller cylinder.
8:25
Upon zooming in, observe flashing and
8:28
crisscrossed lines between the screw and
8:31
the line roller, visually indicating
8:34
interferences.
8:38
This confirms the absence of a drilled
8:40
hole in the line roller for the screw.
8:44
Accept the section view by pressing
8:46
okay.
8:48
Toggle the screws visibility off by
8:51
selecting it and pressing the Vshort
8:54
key.
8:55
This clearly shows the missing hole in
8:58
the line roller.
9:00
Press V again to restore the screws
9:03
visibility.
9:05
Refer to exhibit 9.
9:09
An analysis folder now appears in the
9:11
browser.
9:13
Expanding it reveals our two section
9:15
analyses.
9:18
Activate section one and observe the
9:20
design from the front view on the view
9:23
cube.
9:24
From this perspective, the spool appears
9:27
excessively close to the bail. Its
9:30
diameter could be adjusted for a better
9:32
fit.
9:35
To modify the spool component, click
9:38
edit and place in the browser.
9:42
Then expand its sketches and enable
9:45
sketch one.
9:48
The sketches dimensions will become
9:50
visible.
9:52
If they are not displayed, rightclick
9:55
sketch one in the browser and select
9:57
show dimensions.
10:00
Doubleclick the 38.5 diameter dimension
10:04
and change it to 37.5.
10:08
Observe
10:10
how the model updates and how easily the
10:13
result is seen in the section analysis
10:15
view.
10:17
Finally, click finish edit in place and
10:21
disable sketch one.
10:25
Refer to exhibit 10.
10:30
To determine how well balanced a fishing
10:33
reel feels during use, we need to find
10:36
the center of mass of the entire
10:38
assembly.
10:40
From the inspect menu, select center of
10:43
mass.
10:46
Then in the browser, click on the top
10:48
level assembly and press okay.
10:52
A center of mass icon will appear in the
10:55
viewport.
10:58
Viewing the assembly from the top view
11:00
by clicking top on the view cube. You
11:04
might notice that the center of mass
11:06
icon doesn't appear centered within the
11:08
reel, which might seem unusual.
11:12
This is because the center of mass
11:14
calculation accounts for the mass
11:16
properties of all of the individual
11:18
parts and some of our parts must have
11:21
incorrect mass properties.
11:24
Refer to exhibit 11.
11:28
In the browser, expand handle start.
11:32
Right click on handle and select
11:35
properties.
11:37
Observe that the material is currently
11:39
listed as steel, which needs to be
11:42
changed to ABS plastic.
11:45
Close the properties window.
11:48
Next, edit and place the handle start
11:51
component.
11:54
Navigate to the modify menu and choose
11:57
physical material.
12:00
Expand the plastic folder and drag ABS
12:05
plastic onto the handle.
12:08
To refresh the display, turn off and
12:11
then turn back on the center of mass
12:13
display in the browser.
12:16
You should now see that the center of
12:18
mass has been updated and is more
12:20
centralized.
12:23
refer to exhibit 12.
12:26
We can also find out how much the whole
12:28
assembly weighs by right-clicking on the
12:30
fishing reel assembly in the browser and
12:33
selecting properties.
12:37
It returns a weight of around 265 g.
12:42
Let's save our design since we've made
12:44
some changes.
12:46
Click on the save icon and notice that
12:49
it is saving all of the components that
12:51
we've made modifications to.
12:54
In the next video, we will learn how to
12:56
create a drawing set of our fishing reel
12:59
design.
