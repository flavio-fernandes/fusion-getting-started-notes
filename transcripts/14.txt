In this video, the 14th in the getting
0:03
started series, we will learn about
0:05
creating a drawing of your design and
0:08
learn some additional functionality such
0:10
as document settings, parts list tables,
0:15
creating sheets,
0:17
smart dimensions,
0:19
autodimensions,
0:21
and automatic drawing creation.
0:24
We will explore both manual and
0:27
automatic methods for creating a drawing
0:29
set in Fusion in this video.
0:32
With the fishing reel assembly design
0:34
open, go to the file menu and select new
0:38
drawing from design.
0:41
The create drawing dialogue will appear
0:43
and allow you to specify some settings.
0:46
We will start by keeping the manual
0:48
setting.
0:50
The next option is what we want to
0:52
create a drawing of. the whole assembly,
0:55
only what's displayed on the screen or
0:58
only what we select.
1:00
For this example, we will do the full
1:02
assembly.
1:04
Change the standard from ISO to ASME,
1:08
but leave the units at millimeters.
1:11
Finally, change the sheet size to C and
1:15
press okay.
1:18
Refer to exhibit one.
1:21
A new drawing design tab will appear
1:24
along with a C-sized title block. If you
1:28
move your cursor, you will see a
1:30
graphical thumbnail of the fishing reel
1:32
assembly attached to the cursor.
1:35
In the drawing view dialogue, change the
1:38
orientation to northeast isometric and
1:42
notice how the thumbnail updates.
1:45
First, set the scale from 1:2 to 2: 1 to
1:51
enlarge it on the screen.
1:53
Next, change the style to shaded and
1:57
enable full length tangent edges.
2:02
Finally, click the left side of the
2:05
screen to position the isometric view
2:07
and press okay.
2:10
Refer to exhibit two.
2:13
Access the smart table icon located
2:16
above the tables menu.
2:19
This feature intelligently analyzes the
2:22
drawing to generate the appropriate
2:24
table type. For assemblies, it
2:27
automatically creates a parts list. Had
2:30
a sheet metal flat pattern been used, it
2:33
would have generated a bend table
2:35
instead.
2:37
Position the table in the upper right
2:39
corner of the sheet border.
2:42
The table is generated, but the text
2:44
appears somewhat small.
2:47
To adjust the default text size, locate
2:50
and click the change document settings
2:53
icon within the browser.
2:56
From there, modify the text height group
3:00
size from medium to large.
3:04
This settings dialogue provides access
3:07
to a wide array of drawing
3:09
configurations
3:10
including linear precision,
3:13
leading or trailing zeros,
3:17
dimension colors and arrow heads,
3:20
view defaults,
3:22
and automation settings among others.
3:27
Refer to exhibit 3.
3:30
Adjust the column widths of the table by
3:33
clicking and dragging to accommodate the
3:35
larger text and the table will
3:37
automatically update.
3:41
If necessary,
3:43
reposition the isometric view by
3:45
clicking and dragging on it.
3:48
The item balloons were automatically
3:50
created, but we want to reorder the item
3:53
numbers.
3:54
In the tables menu, select reumber and
3:59
then click on the top balloon.
4:02
Then continue clicking down the balloons
4:05
and notice they reumber and the table
4:07
reorders accordingly.
4:12
Create a new sheet by clicking on the
4:14
quick add plus icon at the bottom of the
4:17
screen.
4:19
In the main menu, click on base view to
4:22
place a base view of the assembly.
4:27
Set the scale to 3:1 and then place the
4:31
view and press okay.
4:37
We want to have a view of only a single
4:39
component and not of the whole assembly.
4:43
So right click on the spool and select
4:46
suppress all except selected and all of
4:50
the other components will get removed
4:52
from the view.
4:54
Refer to exhibit 4.
4:57
Now use the projected view command from
5:00
the main menu and select the front view
5:03
as the parent and place a top and
5:07
isometric view.
5:09
Then press the check box to accept.
5:13
Right click on the isometric view and
5:16
select edit view from the marking menu
5:18
to change the settings of the view.
5:22
Change the style of the view to be
5:24
shaded and then close the dialogue.
5:28
There is a lot of detail on the inside
5:30
of the spool. So we should create a
5:33
section view to slice through the spool.
5:37
Click on section view from the main
5:39
menu. Then click on the top view to
5:43
select it as the parent view.
5:46
Hover over the left side of the circle
5:49
and the selection line will snap to the
5:51
center of the circle.
5:54
Then click to start the section line.
5:59
Move to the right of the circle and
6:00
click again to finish the horizontal
6:03
section line.
6:05
A section preview will now be snapped to
6:08
your cursor and it wants to place it
6:10
either above or below the top view.
6:14
You can press the shift key once to
6:16
toggle out of the vertical alignment.
6:20
Place the section view to the right of
6:22
the top view and press okay.
6:26
Refer to exhibit 5.
6:28
To properly document the design, we need
6:31
to add dimensions to the drawing.
6:34
We'll utilize the smart dimension tool
6:37
by clicking the dimension icon located
6:40
above the dimension menu.
6:43
This versatile tool automatically
6:45
identifies the element you select and
6:48
generates the appropriate dimension type
6:50
such as a radius, diameter, angle, or
6:54
linear dimension.
6:56
For example, clicking the top horizontal
6:59
line automatically recognizes it as a
7:02
circular projection.
7:04
dimensioning it as a 27 mm diameter.
7:08
To place a 15 mm linear dimension, click
7:12
the bottom edge and then the edge of the
7:15
spools shelf.
7:18
An angular dimension of 120° can be
7:21
created by clicking the angular line at
7:24
the top and the horizontal line.
7:28
Finally, to add a radius dimension to a
7:31
fillet, rightclick it and select radius.
7:37
Double clicking the R1 dimension allows
7:39
you to add TYP to the end, signifying
7:44
that all radi on the spool are radius
7:47
one unless otherwise specified.
7:51
In the dimension menu, you will see all
7:54
of the individual types of dimensions
7:56
you can create.
7:58
Let's create baseline dimensions off of
8:01
the existing 15 mm dimension.
8:04
Select baseline dimension from the menu.
8:08
Then click on the bottom extension line
8:10
of the 15 dimension on the screen.
8:13
Then click the two horizontal lines on
8:16
top of the spool to place the 30.5
8:20
and the 33 mm dimensions.
8:24
Refer to exhibit six.
8:28
In the top view, first zoom in.
8:33
Then use the center mark pattern
8:36
command, clicking the two arcs of the
8:38
slot to add center marks.
8:43
Next, dimension the slots width and
8:46
diameter using the dimension tool.
8:51
Finally, dimension the diameters of the
8:53
circles in the top view.
8:57
refer to exhibit 7.
9:01
The title block has text attributes in
9:04
it that you can edit.
9:06
Double click on the title block and it
9:08
will zoom up onto the screen.
9:11
Then click on title two and type in
9:15
spool and press enter.
9:20
While the previous example required
9:22
manual dimensioning, Fusion offers an
9:25
automatic dimensioning tool that
9:27
streamlines the process.
9:30
To utilize this, create a new sheet and
9:34
add a base view with a 2:1 scale and
9:38
shortened tangent edges.
9:43
In the browser, right click on the bail
9:46
and select suppress all except selected.
9:52
Afterward, add top, right, and isometric
9:56
projected views.
9:59
Finally, set the isometric view to
10:02
shaded.
10:04
From the dimension menu, choose auto
10:07
dimension.
10:10
The autodimension dialogue will appear
10:12
offering various dimension styles like
10:15
symmetric, orordinate and baseline.
10:21
You can also use the density slider to
10:23
adjust the number of dimensions
10:25
displayed.
10:29
While the auto dimension tool
10:30
significantly reduces the effort and
10:32
time required, you are still responsible
10:35
for ensuring all necessary dimensions
10:37
are present.
10:40
You will likely want to reposition,
10:42
delete, or add dimensions as needed.
10:49
Finally, edit the title block and rename
10:52
it to bale.
10:56
Refer to exhibit 8.
10:59
You would continue using this process
11:01
for creating sheets for each of the
11:03
other components. You would add a new
11:06
sheet, place the base view, display only
11:09
the component you want, create the
11:12
projected views, and then edit the view
11:14
settings for each sheet.
11:17
Then you would either manually or
11:19
automatically add the dimensions.
11:22
Well, there's an easier way, and that is
11:24
to use Fusion's automatic drawing
11:27
creation.
11:29
We wanted to use a specific drawing
11:32
template. So, upload the getting started
11:35
series title block file into your
11:38
getting started series project from the
11:40
exhibits.
11:44
Return to the fishing reel assembly tab
11:47
and select file then new drawing from
11:51
design.
11:53
This time, choose automatic in the
11:56
create drawing dialogue.
11:59
From the template dropdown, click browse
12:02
and navigate to the getting started
12:04
series project to select the getting
12:07
started series title block template.
12:10
Observe that the standard units and
12:13
sheet size options became grayed out as
12:16
they are predefined by the template.
12:20
Finally, adjust the structure to all
12:23
level and enable external components.
12:28
Refer to exhibit nine.
12:32
Fusion's automatic drawing process runs
12:34
in the background, allowing you to
12:36
continue working.
12:38
You'll receive a notification when the
12:40
drawing set is complete.
12:44
Upon completion, click open drawing.
12:50
The selected template will generate a
12:53
shaded isometric view with a complete
12:55
parts list on the first sheet.
12:59
The next sheet displays a top, front,
13:02
right, and a shaded isometric view of
13:04
the entire assembly, including overall
13:07
dimensions.
13:11
Next, as you go through the sheets,
13:13
you'll find the individual components
13:15
with their automatic dimensions.
13:18
You might need to reposition, add, or
13:21
remove some of these dimensions to suit
13:23
your preferences, as previously
13:25
demonstrated.
13:28
Additionally, you have the option to
13:30
delete or rearrange sheets if needed.
13:38
There are many other commands in the
13:39
drawing workspace we don't have time to
13:41
cover in this video, such as detail
13:44
views, broken views, leader notes,
13:48
symbols, custom tables, and more.
13:54
With the drawing set finalized, you can
13:56
now export it as a PDF or DWG.
14:01
Select export PDF and observe the
14:04
options to export all sheets, a specific
14:07
sheet, or a range.
14:10
Enable open PDF and ensure line weights
14:14
remains checked before clicking okay.
14:19
The PDF will then open displaying the
14:22
highquality output.
14:26
Back in Fusion, click on the save icon
14:29
to save the drawing into the project.
14:32
In the next video, we will learn about
14:34
manufacturing with Fusion.
