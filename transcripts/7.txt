In this video, the seventh in the
0:03
getting started series, we will work
0:05
with imported geometry and learn some
0:07
additional functionality such as
0:10
uploading and step files, direct
0:13
editing,
0:15
rigid groups,
0:17
constrain components,
0:19
edit in place, and asbuilt joints.
0:26
To start out, we need to upload some
0:28
files that are linked in exhibit one.
0:31
After saving those files locally onto
0:34
your computer, navigate to the getting
0:36
started series in your data panel in
0:38
Fusion and select upload.
0:43
Either drag and drop the bale arms file
0:46
into the drag and drop area in the
0:48
dialogue from a file window or click the
0:52
select files button and navigate to
0:55
where you saved the downloaded files to
0:57
select it.
1:00
After that, click the upload button in
1:02
the dialogue to complete the upload
1:04
process.
1:06
Refer to exhibit one.
1:10
Repeat the process to upload the real
1:12
body step file into the getting started
1:14
series project.
1:18
In the design process, it is useful to
1:21
reuse existing designs that may have
1:23
been used in a different product instead
1:25
of recreating it. Those designs may have
1:28
even come from a different CAD design
1:30
tool. With Fusion, you can insert those
1:33
other models into your design and even
1:35
modify them using direct editing even
1:38
though they have no design history
1:40
associated with them.
1:42
To insert the file into our design,
1:45
right click on the bale arms file in the
1:48
data panel and select insert into
1:51
current design.
1:54
Click okay to accept the position.
1:58
You will notice that if I drag on some
2:00
of the imported components, they move
2:02
independently of each other. This is due
2:05
to the fact that they are imported
2:07
geometry with no history or
2:09
relationships.
2:11
Because the parts are already positioned
2:13
together, we can create a rigid group
2:16
and group all of the components
2:17
together.
2:19
Now, if we move one of the components,
2:22
they all move together.
2:25
This is a fast method instead of having
2:27
to rebuild all of the relationships such
2:29
as positioning the screws into the
2:31
holes.
2:34
To constrain the imported geometry onto
2:36
the bail, navigate to the assemble menu,
2:40
select constrain components,
2:44
and then choose the circular edge of the
2:46
bail arm followed by the circular edge
2:49
of the hole in the bail.
2:53
Now when we drag on the bail arms, they
2:55
rotate around the hole because we
2:57
constrained the circular edges and their
2:59
faces together.
3:03
We need to modify the imported design,
3:06
specifically removing a hole from the
3:08
smaller arm. Directly deleting it is not
3:11
possible because the geometry is linked
3:14
to the original design as indicated by
3:16
the chain link icon in the browser.
3:20
To make changes, hover over the bail
3:23
arms assembly in the browser and select
3:26
edit in place.
3:28
This special editing mode allows
3:30
modifications to the imported design.
3:34
Refer to exhibit 2.
3:37
To remove the small hole in the arm,
3:39
click it and press delete on your
3:41
keyboard.
3:43
Next, select the flat face of the small
3:46
arm, right click and choose press pull.
3:51
Drag the blue arrow to extend the bale
3:54
wire arm and enter 2 mm for the
3:57
distance.
3:59
This method is called direct editing
4:01
because you are modifying the model
4:03
directly rather than adjusting sketches
4:06
or dimensions which are not present in
4:08
imported geometry.
4:11
Looking at the other arm, we can see
4:13
three ridges on the top that we don't
4:15
want as part of our design.
4:18
Click on one of the ridges and hit
4:20
delete.
4:22
Fusion heals the underlying geometry
4:24
automatically.
4:27
Pre-seelelect the other two ribs, right
4:30
mouse click and select delete.
4:33
Refer to exhibit three.
4:36
Rotate to the other side of the line
4:38
roller and click on the hole command
4:41
from the create menu.
4:43
Click on the side of the roller to place
4:45
the hole.
4:48
Reference the back face of the roller
4:50
and enter 2 mm for the distance.
4:54
Change the center angle to 45°.
5:00
Finally, set the hole diameter to 1.7 mm
5:04
and the whole depth to 5 mm and press
5:07
okay.
5:10
Refer to exhibit 4.
5:13
We are done editing our parts. So, click
5:16
on finish edit in place across the top
5:19
of the viewport.
5:21
Open the data panel and insert the real
5:24
body into your design.
5:28
It will probably come in on top of the
5:30
bail, so drag one of the arrows to move
5:32
it off to one side.
5:35
Close the data panel to give you more
5:37
viewport real estate. Again, the parts
5:40
come in assembled, but there are no
5:42
assembly relationships.
5:45
We will use the rigid group command to
5:47
group many of the parts together.
5:49
However, we will leave out the shaft as
5:52
we want it to be able to rotate.
5:55
expand. Open the real body assembly and
5:57
then the main body subasssembly.
6:01
Under the assemble menu, select rigid
6:04
group and then select all of the
6:06
components except for the shaft.
6:09
Refer to exhibit 5.
6:13
Since the shaft is already correctly
6:15
positioned, we can utilize the asbuilt
6:18
joint command.
6:20
From the assemble menu, select as built
6:23
joint.
6:25
Then in the viewport, select both the
6:28
shaft and the bearing components.
6:32
In the subsequent dialogue, change the
6:34
motion type to revolute and then select
6:37
a radial edge of the bearing.
6:40
This action will cause the shaft to
6:42
rotate around the bearing's axis as
6:45
demonstrated in the preview.
6:48
Refer to exhibit six.
6:51
If we try and rotate the shaft, you will
6:53
notice that the whole assembly moves as
6:55
one. We need to constrain the real body
6:58
so it can't move.
7:01
Start by turning on the main origin in
7:03
the structure browser.
7:05
Also, let's turn off the bail and the
7:08
bail arms components.
7:11
Then click on the constrain components
7:14
command from the assemble menu and
7:17
select the middle bottom point of the
7:18
real body and the 0000 point of the
7:22
origin.
7:25
Refer to exhibit 7.
7:28
When you drag the real component, it
7:30
acts like it's on a ball joint because
7:32
we only constrained a point to a point.
7:36
We need to lock down more degrees of
7:38
freedom.
7:40
In the timeline, edit the constrain
7:42
component feature.
7:46
Click the plus symbol to add another
7:48
constraint.
7:50
Select the side face of the real body
7:53
and then the side plane of the origin
7:56
and then press okay.
7:59
Refer to exhibit 8.
8:02
Rotate the assembly again to observe how
8:04
this new constraint affects its
8:06
movement. It can still rotate forward
8:09
and back. So, a final constraint is
8:11
needed to lock it down.
8:14
Edit the constraint component feature
8:16
again and click the plus symbol to add a
8:18
third constraint.
8:20
Click on the front flat face of the real
8:23
body and the front plane of the origin.
8:27
Refer to exhibit 9.
8:30
Now, when we drag on the reel, you'll
8:32
notice it can't move. And if we drag on
8:34
the shaft, it rotates due to the asbuilt
8:38
joint we created earlier.
8:41
Turn the bail and bail arms components
8:43
back on in the browser. We want to
8:46
position them where they need to go.
8:48
However, you will notice there is an
8:50
anchor symbol on the bail component.
8:53
This means that it is grounded to its
8:55
parent, which Fusion does automatically.
8:58
For example, if you created a door
9:00
component and then created a door knob
9:03
component as a child, it would
9:05
automatically be grounded to the door
9:07
component. That way, if you moved the
9:10
door, the door knob would move with it.
9:13
You didn't have to create any joint or
9:15
constraint relationships.
9:18
In this case, we do not want the bail to
9:20
be grounded. So, we will rightclick on
9:22
it in the browser and select unground
9:25
from parent.
9:28
Use the constrain components command and
9:31
select the bottom circular edge of the
9:33
bail and then the bottom circular edge
9:36
of the top of the real body and press
9:39
okay.
9:40
This will create a revolute relation
9:42
between the two circular edges.
9:46
Refer to exhibit 10.
9:49
If we rotate the bail, notice that the
9:51
shaft does not rotate with it. That is
9:54
because it is part of the reel and not
9:56
part of the bail. We want to group them
9:59
together. So we will use the rigid group
10:01
command again and select the shaft and
10:05
the bail.
10:08
Now when we rotate the bail, the shaft
10:10
rotates with it.
10:13
Let's save this assembly as a new
10:15
design. Go to the file menu and then
10:18
select save as.
10:21
A dialogue might appear warning of
10:23
unsaved edit in place changes.
10:26
That is because we made directedit
10:28
modifications to some of the components
10:30
and we haven't saved them yet. Go ahead
10:33
and press continue.
10:37
Type in fishing reel for the file name
10:40
and confirm that you are saving in the
10:42
getting started series project before
10:44
hitting okay.
10:47
In the next video, we will use the sweep
10:49
command to create the bail wire.
