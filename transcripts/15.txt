In this video, the 15th in the getting
0:03
started series, we will learn about the
0:05
manufacturing workspace and learn some
0:08
additional functionality such as setups,
0:12
creating tool paths, simulation,
0:16
patterns, and post-processing.
0:20
The manufacturer workspace in Fusion
0:22
streamlines the process from a designed
0:25
model to a manufactured part. It enables
0:28
the creation of tool paths and
0:30
subsequent post-processing to generate
0:33
the necessary G-code for machine
0:35
operation.
0:37
Start by opening the spool individually.
0:41
Then switch to the manufacturer
0:44
workspace from the workspace menu.
0:48
It is broken down into milling, turning,
0:51
and additive subsections.
0:53
Our spool is going to require a few
0:56
different methods for manufacturing such
0:59
as turning and milling.
1:02
We will start by clicking on the turning
1:04
menu.
1:05
Verify that we are in millimeters for
1:07
our units.
1:11
The first step is to create a setup for
1:13
the machine to understand.
1:16
Click on new setup under the setup menu.
1:21
The first tab allows you to specify the
1:24
WCS or work coordinate system location
1:28
and direction.
1:30
We will leave the defaults for now. It
1:33
also shows the safe planes for the front
1:36
and the back for the chuck.
1:40
Click on the stock tab and change the
1:42
model position to offset from front and
1:46
change the offset distance to 1 mm.
1:50
This will move the part closer to the
1:52
front and require less material to be
1:55
removed during the following facing
1:57
operation.
1:59
Refer to exhibit one.
2:02
We will now create our initial tool
2:04
path, a facing operation.
2:08
From the turning menu, choose turning
2:11
face.
2:12
The dialogue box divided into five
2:15
distinct tabs will then appear.
2:19
The first tab is dedicated to tool
2:21
selection for cutting the tool path.
2:25
Click select next to tool to open the
2:28
tool dialogue.
2:30
In the library section, choose turning
2:33
tools metric to narrow the display to
2:36
only metric turning tools.
2:39
Finally, select the DVLNR tool from the
2:43
list.
2:48
After defining the tool, a tool path is
2:51
automatically generated.
2:55
The various tabs allow you to review the
2:57
geometry,
2:59
retract clearances,
3:02
number of passes,
3:05
stock to leave,
3:07
and leads and transitions.
3:10
For instance, deselecting the leadin
3:13
entry option will update the tool path
3:16
to exclude the 45 degree leadin.
3:21
Reenable the leadin option. Then click
3:24
okay to confirm the facing tool path. To
3:28
verify the tool path, click on simulate
3:31
with machine.
3:33
Click on the play button to see what the
3:36
machine would do to cut the facing tool
3:38
path.
3:40
If it plays too quickly, you can drag
3:42
the speed slider to slow down or speed
3:45
up the playback.
3:47
Change the colorization to comparison to
3:51
see blue material as stock and green
3:54
material as machined faces.
3:57
Then exit the simulation.
4:00
Now we want to cut the main profile
4:02
shape of the spool with a roughing
4:04
strategy and then follow that with a
4:06
finishing strategy.
4:09
Select profile roughing from the turning
4:12
menu.
4:14
Under the passes tab, notice the option
4:17
for stock to leave is turned on.
4:21
This option will remove a majority of
4:23
the material, but leave a small amount
4:26
to get removed during the finishing
4:28
process.
4:29
We'll leave everything default and press
4:31
okay.
4:34
The tool path is created, but notice
4:36
that it can't cut under the top portion
4:38
of the spool.
4:40
Refer to exhibit two.
4:43
It is recommended to run a simulation
4:45
after creating a tool path to visualize
4:48
what it is doing.
4:50
As we can see during this simulation, it
4:53
is cutting the small grooves which we
4:55
would rather have cut during the
4:57
finishing process.
4:59
Right click on the roughing tool path in
5:01
the browser and select edit.
5:04
In the geometry tab, activate groove
5:08
suppression and then select the six
5:11
faces of the small grooves and press
5:14
okay.
5:16
Simulate again and notice that the
5:19
grooves are no longer cut.
5:22
Refer to exhibit three.
5:26
We need to remove the small area below
5:28
the top of the spool. And we have
5:31
already spent some time setting
5:32
everything up in the first roughing tool
5:34
path. So, let's duplicate it so we can
5:37
reuse all of the existing settings and
5:40
just change a few settings.
5:43
Right click on the tool path in the
5:44
browser and select duplicate.
5:49
Edit the new tool path and click on
5:51
select next to tool.
5:55
Choose the DVLN Lf left-hand tool and
5:59
press okay.
6:03
Press okay for the tool path and notice
6:05
that it is cutting a lot of the same
6:07
area that has already been removed. This
6:10
is basically wasting time.
6:13
Edit the tool path again and under the
6:16
geometry tab, hover over the words rest
6:20
machining for the tool tip to appear.
6:24
Notice this option only cuts material
6:26
not removed by the previous operation.
6:30
Turn on rest machining and press okay.
6:34
The tool path updates and is now only
6:36
cutting the small area necessary.
6:40
Refer to exhibit 4.
6:43
With most of the material roughed out,
6:45
we can now concentrate on the finishing
6:47
passes.
6:49
We'll leverage the previously set up
6:51
tool paths to expedite this process.
6:55
Rightclick the first roughing tool path,
6:58
then choose create derived operation,
7:02
followed by turning, and finally turning
7:06
profile finishing.
7:09
This action copies existing settings
7:12
while adapting specific options for a
7:14
finishing profile.
7:16
For instance, upon editing the tool
7:19
path, you'll observe that stock to leave
7:22
have been disabled.
7:25
In the browser, you'll see a warning
7:28
icon on the tool path. Hover over it for
7:31
an explanation. The lead out was
7:34
modified to prevent gouging the stock,
7:37
resulting in a straight upward exit
7:39
instead of a 45° angle.
7:43
To avoid scraping the stock, uncheck
7:46
same as lead in and set the lead out
7:49
angle to 135°.
7:55
Refer to exhibit 5.
7:58
Repeat the create derived turning
8:01
profile finishing operation on the
8:03
second roughing tool path.
8:07
This time you will need to turn off the
8:09
groove suppression and then press okay.
8:14
run a simulate on the whole setup to
8:17
verify the tool paths are cutting the
8:19
way we expect.
8:23
Now let's focus on drilling the holes in
8:26
the spool body.
8:28
From the drilling menu, select drill.
8:33
Next to tool, click select and then
8:36
choose hole making tools metric from the
8:40
library. To begin, we'll use a spot
8:43
drill.
8:45
Filter the selection by clicking spot
8:47
drill under type.
8:50
Finally, select the 5 mm spot drill from
8:53
the list and press select.
8:56
Refer to exhibit six.
9:00
Click on the multiaxis tab and turn on
9:03
tool orientation.
9:07
Select the 3mm hole currently pointing
9:10
in the X direction of the view cube.
9:14
The Z-axis will reorient, but it's
9:17
pointed down instead of up.
9:20
Click on the flip Z-axis option. And now
9:24
Z should be pointing up.
9:27
refer to exhibit 7.
9:30
Now click on the geometry tab and select
9:34
the 3 mm hole on the Z-axis.
9:38
Click on the heights tab and a preview
9:41
will appear of the spot drill.
9:45
Change the bottom height to hole top and
9:49
then set the offset to minus 1 mm.
9:53
This will keep the spot drill from
9:55
drilling so deep.
9:58
If we wanted to use the spot drill to
10:00
chamer the edge of the hole, we could
10:02
set the offset to go deeper.
10:06
Since the holes are part of a pattern,
10:08
you can create a pattern for the drill
10:11
tool path.
10:13
To do this, rightclick the drill tool
10:16
path and choose add to new pattern.
10:21
Change the pattern type to circular
10:23
pattern
10:24
and then select the outside of the spool
10:27
as the axis.
10:30
Increase the number of instances from 2
10:33
to 12.
10:36
Ideally, you should link the pattern
10:38
quantity to the actual pattern
10:40
parameter.
10:41
To do this, switch from the manufacturer
10:44
workspace to the design workspace.
10:48
Then under the modify menu, select
10:52
change parameters.
10:55
In the parameters dialogue, expand spool
10:59
and then see pattern one. You'll see
11:03
count U with a D number in its name and
11:07
an expression of 12.
11:11
Double click the D number and rename it
11:14
to whole quantity
11:16
and then click okay.
11:19
Refer to exhibit 8.
11:22
Return to the manufacturer workspace and
11:25
modify the pattern in the browser.
11:30
Replace the current value of 12 for the
11:33
number of instances with whole quantity.
11:38
This will link it as a parameter,
11:41
allowing the pattern to automatically
11:43
update if you change the quantity of
11:45
holes in your design.
11:48
With the hole locations now marked, we
11:51
can proceed to drill them. To save setup
11:54
time, we will duplicate our existing
11:56
tool path.
11:58
Right click on the drill tool path and
12:00
select duplicate.
12:03
Then edit the new tool path and click
12:07
select next to tool.
12:10
From the library, choose hole making
12:13
tools metric.
12:16
We need a specific drill size. So expand
12:19
the diameter filter.
12:22
Type in three and press enter.
12:25
This will filter the tools to display
12:28
only those with a 3 mm diameter.
12:32
Finally, select the 3mm drill from the
12:35
filtered list.
12:37
On the heights tab, revert the bottom
12:40
height to whole bottom and set the
12:43
offset to 0 mm.
12:46
Enable drill tip through bottom and
12:49
specify a breakthrough depth of 1 millm
12:53
to ensure adequate chip clearing.
12:57
Simulate the pattern to verify the
12:59
result.
13:08
To further demonstrate the mill turn
13:10
capabilities, we'll perform a milling
13:13
operation to remove material from the
13:15
top of the spool.
13:18
Navigate to the milling tab and select
13:20
2D adaptive clearing.
13:24
Next to tool, click select. Then choose
13:28
milling tools metric
13:31
and set the type to bullnose endmill.
13:35
From the list, select the 5 mm diameter
13:38
bullnose.
13:42
First, navigate to the geometry tab.
13:46
From there, select face contours
13:49
and then click on both the large flat
13:52
face and the small fillet located on the
13:55
top of the spool.
13:57
Within the face contours dialogue box,
14:00
adjust the loops option to outer loops
14:04
and set the side to start inside.
14:09
These selections instruct Fusion to
14:11
identify the outermost profile of the
14:14
chosen faces and machine all of the
14:17
areas contained within that profile.
14:20
Finally, in the passes tab, disable
14:24
stock to leave.
14:26
Refer to exhibit 9.
14:30
Simulate the adaptive tool path and
14:33
notice the small blue area left in the
14:35
corner.
14:36
This is showing that the radius of the
14:38
bullnose endmill is larger than the
14:41
radius of our model and the tool can't
14:43
remove all of the material. We would
14:46
need to use a smaller radiused tool to
14:49
get into the corner.
14:51
It also makes sense to move the milling
14:54
operation to be earlier in the
14:55
manufacturing process as it could put
14:58
stress on the part as it's roughing out
15:00
the pocket.
15:02
You can reorder the tool paths just by
15:04
dragging them.
15:08
We'll verify by doing a simulation one
15:10
last time before we post out to the
15:12
machine.
15:14
Now, obviously, there are more tooling
15:16
operations that need to be done to fully
15:18
manufacture the spool, but this video is
15:20
just an introduction to the
15:22
manufacturing process inside of Fusion.
15:26
The simulation completes with no
15:28
verification errors. So, we are ready to
15:31
post the G-code.
15:34
From the action menu, click on post
15:37
process.
15:39
From the post pulld down, click on
15:42
choose from library and then click on
15:45
fusion library.
15:49
Here is where you can select the machine
15:51
that you will be using or upload a
15:53
custom post from a vendor.
15:55
In our example, we will be using a HOS
15:58
ST10 machine.
16:02
Filter the vendor to HOS automation and
16:05
then choose HOS ST10 from the list and
16:09
press select.
16:12
In the configuration section, enable got
16:16
live tooling to inform the post that a
16:19
milling spindle is being used.
16:22
All other post options should remain at
16:24
their default settings.
16:26
Finally, press post to generate the
16:29
G-code,
16:31
which will then be ready to be sent to
16:33
the machine.
16:35
Refer to exhibit 10.
16:39
Go ahead and save your model.
16:43
In the next video, we will learn about
16:45
configurations and how changing your
16:47
design will update your manufacturing
16:49
tool paths and drawings.
