In this video, the ninth in the getting
0:03
started series, we will learn about the
0:05
loft command and learn some additional
0:07
functionality such as shortcut key,
0:11
profile direction,
0:13
takeoff, weight,
0:15
guide, rails,
0:17
and timeline marker.
0:21
To save some time, some of the
0:23
components for this video have already
0:25
been created. Start by uploading the
0:28
handle start file from exhibit one into
0:30
your getting started series project.
0:34
Once that is complete, open the handle
0:36
start file into fusion.
0:39
Refer to exhibit one.
0:42
Activate the handle component by
0:44
clicking its radio button in the
0:46
browser.
0:48
We will construct the handle using this
0:50
black component as a base.
0:53
Right click on the end face and choose
0:55
extrude.
0:58
Enter 13 mm for the distance.
1:03
Rightclick the end face and choose
1:05
create sketch.
1:08
In the previous video, we covered the
1:11
shortcut key P for the project command.
1:15
This time, let's explore the shortcuts
1:17
dialogue by pressing the S key. A
1:21
dialogue will appear allowing you to
1:23
search for any command.
1:25
For instance, if you anticipate frequent
1:28
use of the ellipse command in your
1:30
design, begin typing ellipse.
1:34
Observe how the command list filters as
1:37
you type.
1:39
Once you locate ellipse in the filtered
1:42
list, navigate to it and press the up
1:45
arrow next to it to add it to your
1:48
shortcuts dialogue.
1:50
Now, whenever you press the S key within
1:53
a sketch, the ellipse command will be
1:56
available in that dialogue.
1:59
You can add any of your preferred
2:01
commands into the shortcut dialogue.
2:04
Furthermore, each workspace, such as the
2:07
sketch, model, and drawing workspaces,
2:10
has its own unique shortcut dialogue.
2:14
Project the end of the circular handle
2:16
component onto the sketch.
2:19
Then draw a 9 mm circle below it.
2:25
Vertically align this new circle with
2:27
the projected circle and dimension it to
2:31
be 43 mm below it.
2:35
Finally, press finish sketch.
2:39
Refer to exhibit 2.
2:43
Right click on the circular profile and
2:45
choose extrude.
2:48
Enter 8 millimeters for the distance,
2:51
but we want the extrusion to start
2:53
offset from where it currently is.
2:56
In the start section of the dialogue,
2:59
change the profile plane to offset and
3:03
enter 5 mm for the offset distance.
3:09
Notice that the extrusion is still 8 mm
3:11
long, but offset 5 mm from the sketch
3:15
plane.
3:17
refer to exhibit three.
3:20
The loft command takes one profile and
3:23
changes it to another profile along a
3:25
path. For example, going from a circle
3:28
to a square. To do this, it requires
3:32
some sketches for reference.
3:35
For our handle, we're going to loft from
3:37
a circular profile down to an elliptical
3:40
profile.
3:42
Let's start by creating the elliptical
3:44
profile down on the small cylinder we
3:47
just created.
3:49
We need to create a sketch that goes
3:50
through the center of the cylinder. So
3:52
we will use the axis through cylinder
3:55
construction command we learned in the
3:57
last video.
4:00
Then create a plane at angle
4:03
construction plane on that axis at 0°.
4:09
This plane will serve as the basis for
4:11
our sketch.
4:16
Project the cylinder body onto the
4:18
sketch using the bodies option in the
4:21
project menu.
4:23
Now use the S shortcut key to bring up
4:27
the sketch shortcut menu and you should
4:29
see the ellipse command that you added
4:31
earlier.
4:33
Click on the ellipse command and then
4:36
click left of center on the axis line.
4:40
Then click on the top edge of the
4:41
cylinder. Then enter 3 mm for the width
4:45
of the ellipse.
4:49
Dimension the ellipse to be 3 mm from
4:52
the cylinder's left edge.
4:55
The ellipse will appear cyan, indicating
4:58
that it's not fully constrained.
5:01
To fully constrain it, use the tangent
5:04
constraint to make the ellipse tangent
5:06
to both the top and the bottom of the
5:09
cylinder.
5:11
Once fully constrained, click finish
5:14
sketch.
5:16
Refer to exhibit 4.
5:19
To project the circle onto the handle,
5:22
rightclick the black circular face and
5:25
select create sketch.
5:28
Then press P for project. Remember to
5:32
change the selection filter back to
5:34
specified entities before clicking the
5:37
circular face.
5:40
Finally, click finish sketch.
5:44
We now have sufficient information to
5:46
initiate the loft command.
5:49
Select loft from the create menu.
5:53
First click on the circular profile and
5:56
then on the elliptical profile.
6:00
A red preview will appear indicating
6:02
that it's cutting through our smaller
6:04
cylinder.
6:06
Change the operation to new body.
6:11
Now the loft looks a bit odd as it's
6:13
trying to connect the vertical circle to
6:16
a horizontal ellipse. In the dialogue,
6:20
change the connected next to profile one
6:23
to direction.
6:25
Also change the connected next to
6:27
profile two to direction.
6:31
The loft preview updates and we can see
6:34
what the handle looks like.
6:37
It looks a bit heavy up at profile one.
6:40
So, select profile one in the dialogue
6:43
and drag the arrow to change the takeoff
6:45
weight.
6:48
Around 0.5 looks good.
6:52
You can type 0.5 into the dialogue for
6:55
precise input.
6:58
We can see now that the circular profile
7:00
extends out a bit before changing down
7:03
to the elliptical shape.
7:06
Press okay to accept the settings.
7:09
refer to exhibit 5.
7:14
We created these as separate bodies that
7:16
we now want to combine together.
7:19
Use the combine command to combine the
7:21
handle with the loft and the cylinder.
7:27
Add a 0.5 fillet to all of the edges of
7:30
the small cylinder.
7:38
Then use the hole command to add a 3 mm
7:42
hole through the center of the small
7:44
cylinder.
7:46
Refer to exhibit six.
7:51
The loft command also allows you to
7:53
define a path for the profiles to
7:56
follow. In our example, we did not
7:59
specify a path and just had it loft
8:01
directly from one profile to the other.
8:04
Let's add in a path for the loft to
8:07
follow so you can see how this works.
8:10
Drag the timeline marker to before the
8:12
loft was created as we need the sketch
8:15
to be created before the loft was
8:17
created.
8:20
Turn on sketch 2 and sketch 3 in the
8:22
browser as we will need to reference
8:24
these to create a new sketch.
8:28
In the construct menu, select plane
8:31
through three points and click the three
8:34
points shown in exhibit 7.
8:39
Right click on the plane and select
8:41
create sketch.
8:44
Project the center point of the vertical
8:47
circle and the center point of the
8:49
ellipse onto the sketch.
8:54
Then draw a simple fit point spline from
8:58
the top point down to the bottom point
9:01
in the shape of a question mark.
9:08
Use the horizontal and vertical
9:10
constraint to constrain the green spline
9:13
tangent lines to be horizontal at the
9:16
top point and vertical at the bottom
9:19
point.
9:21
refer to exhibit 8.
9:25
Move the timeline marker to the end of
9:27
the timeline.
9:29
Edit the loft feature and in the loft
9:32
dialogue, select the center line option
9:35
under guide type.
9:38
Then click the spline you just created.
9:42
Observe how the circular profile now
9:44
follows the spline, transforming into an
9:47
ellipse by the time it reaches the
9:49
bottom.
9:50
Press okay.
9:53
Refer to exhibit 9.
9:57
Turn on sketch 4 in the browser and drag
10:00
the spline points around a bit to modify
10:02
the spline to see how it affects the
10:05
loft.
10:09
Click on the undo pull down and select
10:12
the roll timeline marker to here next to
10:16
the whole feature from the undo list.
10:22
Press the save icon to save the design.
10:26
In the next video, we will learn how to
10:28
use the form tool to create the finger
10:31
grip for the handle.
