This video, the fifth in the getting
0:03
started series, will cover editing
0:05
features in the timeline to modify your
0:07
design. Topics covered include editing
0:11
the timeline, pattern command,
0:14
parametric updates, and show dimensions.
0:20
As you look at the timeline for the
0:21
spool, you will see all of the steps or
0:23
features that were used to create the
0:25
spool in the order that we created them.
0:28
However, it has been determined that we
0:30
should add some small ridges to the
0:32
spool where the line is wound. That way,
0:36
there is more texture for the line to
0:38
grip onto.
0:40
To do this, we need to go back in time
0:42
and edit our sketch that we used to
0:45
define the shape of our spool. First,
0:48
confirm that the spool component is
0:50
currently active. You can tell this by
0:53
the radio button next to it in the
0:55
browser.
0:56
If it is not currently active, right
0:59
click on it in the browser and select
1:01
activate component.
1:05
To edit the first sketch in the
1:06
timeline, either doubleclick it or right
1:09
click on it and select edit sketch.
1:13
This action will display the original
1:15
sketch used to create the spools
1:17
profile.
1:20
Begin by drawing a small 1 millm
1:22
diameter circle near the edge where the
1:24
fishing line is spooled.
1:28
Locate the circle 1 mm down from the
1:31
corner and 0.4 mm from the vertical
1:35
edge.
1:38
Refer to exhibit one.
1:42
To duplicate the circle along the
1:44
vertical edge, the most straightforward
1:46
method is to use a pattern.
1:49
Navigate to the create menu and choose
1:51
rectangular pattern.
1:54
Select the circle as your object and
1:56
begin dragging the up or down arrow to
1:59
visualize a preview of the pattern.
2:04
Input 8.7 mm for the extent distance and
2:08
six for the quantity. Then click okay.
2:12
You will now see a pattern of six
2:14
circles extending down along the spool's
2:17
edge within the sketch.
2:20
Refer to exhibit two.
2:24
You will notice that even though we drew
2:25
the circles along the edge, the grooves
2:28
do not show up on our 3D model. This is
2:31
because we now need to modify the
2:33
revolve feature to include the circular
2:36
profiles
2:37
in the timeline. Edit the revolve
2:40
feature.
2:42
Examine the circles closely.
2:45
You'll observe that the overlapping
2:47
segment of the circle with the spool is
2:49
blue, indicating that it's selected.
2:53
The dialogue box also shows that seven
2:56
profiles are currently selected.
3:00
To deselect a segment, hold down the
3:03
control key on a PC or the command key
3:06
on a Mac and click on the small circular
3:10
segment. Then release the control key.
3:14
You'll see the revolve preview update to
3:17
reflect the groove and the number of
3:19
selected profiles will decrease from 7
3:22
to six.
3:24
Refer to exhibit three.
3:27
Continue this process. Hold down the
3:30
control key, select the next small
3:32
circular segment, and repeat until all
3:35
small circular segments are selected and
3:38
all grooves are visible in the preview.
3:42
Refer to exhibit 4.
3:46
Finally, press okay to complete editing
3:49
the revolve feature.
3:54
Parametric modeling offers a significant
3:56
advantage. automatic updates to your
3:58
model when changes are made. For
4:01
instance, since these grooves are
4:03
dimensioned relative to the spool's
4:05
edge, moving that edge will
4:07
automatically reposition the grooves.
4:10
Let's explore this functionality.
4:13
Edit the first sketch in the timeline
4:15
and change the 24 diameter dimension to
4:18
20.
4:20
Refer to exhibit 5,
4:23
then press finish sketch.
4:27
Notice the spool diameter is thinner,
4:29
yet the grooves are still on the edge.
4:33
Now, that was kind of hard to see, so
4:35
let me show you a neat tip. First, let's
4:38
undo what we just did. Go to the undo
4:42
icon at the top and click on the down
4:44
arrow next to it and select back to the
4:47
undoedit sketch.
4:50
This will undo all of the steps back to
4:53
and including where we changed the
4:55
dimension.
4:58
Now expand open the spool component in
5:01
the browser and expand open the sketches
5:03
folder.
5:05
Turn on sketch one by clicking the
5:07
eyeball icon next to it. You should now
5:10
see the sketch lines and the circles.
5:14
Right click on sketch one in the browser
5:17
and select show dimension.
5:20
refer to exhibit six.
5:23
This will turn on all of the dimensions
5:25
in the sketch and allow you to edit the
5:27
dimensions directly on the 3D model
5:30
instead of having to edit the sketch
5:32
from the timeline.
5:35
Double click on the 24 diameter
5:37
dimension and change it to 20. And now
5:39
you can see the 3D model update
5:41
instantly.
5:44
Change the 38.5 diameter dimension to
5:47
42. And notice how the spool updates
5:50
accordingly.
5:53
Click the undo button twice to set the
5:55
dimensions back to their original 38.5
5:58
and 24.
6:02
Press the eyeball icon next to sketch
6:04
one to turn off the sketch.
6:07
Click the save icon at the top of the
6:09
screen to save your changes.
6:12
In the next video, we will create the
6:15
bale component building on some of the
6:17
techniques we have just learned.
