This video, the fourth in the getting
0:04
started series, will cover creating a 3D
0:07
model and modifying it. Topics covered
0:10
include the revolve command, the fillet
0:12
command, marking menu, extrude, hole
0:16
command, patterning, and saving your
0:20
design.
0:22
In the last video, we created a fully
0:25
constrained and dimensioned sketch that
0:27
consists of a closed profile.
0:30
Now, we can use that profile to create
0:32
either an extrude or a revolve. In this
0:36
case, we're going to use the revolve
0:38
command to rotate the profile around an
0:40
axis to create a spun type part.
0:45
When you click on the revolve command
0:47
from the create menu, you'll notice that
0:49
the profile is automatically spun around
0:51
the center line axis.
0:54
Press the okay button to accept the
0:56
default revolve settings.
0:59
We now want to round over some of the
1:01
edges using the fillet command.
1:04
In the modify menu, select fill it.
1:09
Then select the six edges highlighted in
1:12
exhibit one.
1:15
In the fillet dialogue, enter 1 millm
1:18
for the size of the fillets and press
1:20
okay.
1:25
This time, let's select the top inside
1:28
edge of the recess at the top of the
1:30
spool to pre-seelelect the edge. Hold
1:33
down the control key and select the
1:35
bottom inside edge. See exhibit two.
1:41
Now right mouse click to see the marking
1:43
menu.
1:45
This shows you the commands that make
1:47
sense for what you have pre-selected.
1:51
You will notice the chamfer and the
1:53
fillet command in the marking menu.
1:56
Select the fillet command and enter 0.5
2:00
mm for the size.
2:03
This is a great method for quick access
2:05
to commands without having to go to the
2:07
main menu.
2:10
Notice in the timeline it shows the
2:12
steps that we have used to create the
2:14
part so far. First it shows the sketch,
2:18
then the revolve, then the fillet
2:20
features we just created.
2:24
Let's use the marking menu again.
2:26
Pre-select the bottom face of the
2:28
circular recess. Then right mouse click
2:31
to bring up the marking menu. Notice
2:34
that it looks different this time
2:35
because we pre-selected a face instead
2:38
of an edge.
2:40
Choose create sketch to place a sketch
2:42
plane on that pre-selected face.
2:46
In the create menu, select slot, then
2:50
center point slot and click on the 0 0
2:54
point.
2:57
Move to the right and click to define a
2:59
random length. Then move up and click to
3:02
define a random radius.
3:06
We will define the slot with dimensions.
3:08
Next,
3:10
click on the dimension tool or press the
3:13
Dsh shortcut key on your keyboard and
3:16
select the two points defining the
3:18
length of the slot.
3:21
Enter 2 mm for the length.
3:25
Click on the two horizontal lines of the
3:27
slot and enter 2.5 mm for the width of
3:30
the slot.
3:32
The line should turn black, signifying
3:35
that the sketch is fully constrained.
3:38
See exhibit 3.
3:40
Click on finish sketch.
3:43
Begin by zooming in on the newly created
3:46
profile and selecting inside of it.
3:49
Right click to open up the marking menu
3:51
where you'll find extrude as the only
3:53
applicable command.
3:57
Select extrude and then drag the blue
3:59
arrow upwards to see the extrusion join
4:02
or be added to the model.
4:05
Dragging the arrow down conversely turns
4:08
it red, cutting the profile through the
4:10
model.
4:13
Since we need the slot to cut completely
4:15
through the spool, change the extent
4:17
type in the dialogue box from distance
4:20
to all.
4:23
This ensures that even if the spool's
4:25
height is altered later, the slot will
4:28
consistently cut through entirely.
4:31
See exhibit 4.
4:34
Next, we want to add some decorative
4:35
holes to the spool.
4:38
Click on the front plane of the view
4:40
cube so we're looking orthographically
4:42
at the front of the spool.
4:45
To create a 3mm diameter hole on the
4:48
spool, begin by selecting the hole
4:51
command from the create menu.
4:54
Position the cursor near the center of
4:56
the bottom cylindrical face and click
5:00
in the hole dialogue. Initiate the
5:02
reference selection process by clicking
5:05
select next to reference.
5:08
Choose the bottom edge of the spool and
5:10
input a value of 3 mm. Setting the holes
5:14
distance from the edge.
5:17
Specify the whole diameter as 3 mm in
5:20
the diameter field of the dialogue box.
5:24
Lastly, change the extents setting to
5:27
the two option and select the inside
5:30
surface of the spool and confirm with
5:33
okay.
5:35
Refer to exhibit 5.
5:39
To duplicate this hole around the spool,
5:41
begin by accessing the create menu and
5:44
choosing pattern followed by circular
5:47
pattern.
5:49
Within the circular pattern dialogue,
5:52
first set the object type to features.
5:55
Then from the timeline, select the whole
5:58
feature which will highlight in blue
6:01
upon selection.
6:04
Next, locate the axis section in the
6:06
dialogue.
6:08
Click the select button and choose the
6:10
cylindrical face of the spool as the
6:12
axis.
6:15
Initially, a preview of three holes will
6:18
appear.
6:20
Adjust the quantity to 12 and confirm by
6:23
clicking okay.
6:26
To save your design, locate and click
6:28
the save icon in the top menu.
6:32
When the save dialogue box opens, click
6:35
new project in the bottom left corner.
6:39
Name your project getting started series
6:43
and press enter.
6:46
Choose the getting started series from
6:48
the project list.
6:51
We've now established a new project
6:53
which serves as a container for all
6:55
related items. Think of it like a file
6:58
cabinet drawer. You can store folders,
7:01
files, drawings, pictures, and more
7:04
within it.
7:06
Finally, name your files spool at the
7:09
top and click save.
7:12
See exhibit 6.
7:16
In the next video, we will cover editing
7:18
the timeline.
