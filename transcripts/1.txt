Welcome to the Autodesk Fusion getting
0:02
started series. In this comprehensive
0:05
video series, we will guide you through
0:07
the full design to manufacture journey
0:10
using Autodesk Fusion, one of the most
0:13
powerful and versatile tools in modern
0:16
digital fabrication to design a fishing
0:19
reel assembly.
0:21
We'll begin with the fundamentals,
0:23
learning how to create constraintdriven
0:25
sketches and transform those sketches
0:28
into robust 3D models.
0:31
Next, we'll learn how to modify those
0:34
models by editing their features from
0:36
the timeline.
0:37
See the power of parametric modeling by
0:40
changing dimensions or features and
0:43
watch as the model updates
0:44
automatically.
0:46
Building on the foundational core of
0:48
sketching and modeling, you will learn
0:51
how to design a more complex component
0:53
of the fishing reel assembly step by
0:55
step to get a better understanding of
0:58
the design process.
1:00
Once you've grasped the fundamentals,
1:03
we'll introduce you to some of the other
1:04
powerful features of Fusion, such as
1:07
sweeps, lofts, and forms.
1:11
These tools allow you to create the more
1:14
complex shapes you see in the design.
1:18
After designing the individual parts,
1:20
discover how to position and assemble
1:22
them into a complete assembly.
1:25
You'll learn how to use constraints and
1:27
joint relationships to connect
1:30
components and simulate their realworld
1:32
interaction with rigid groups and motion
1:35
links.
1:38
Continuing on our design to manufacture
1:40
journey, discover how to inspect the
1:43
design for potential issues such as
1:46
interfering parts or clearance issues.
1:50
Learn how to utilize Fusion's edit in
1:53
place functionality to make in context
1:56
changes and resolve these issues
1:58
directly within the design.
2:01
Documenting your design is important. So
2:04
you will see how to create a drawing set
2:06
of the fishing reel assembly.
2:09
Also learn about Fusion's automatic AI
2:12
based drawing and dimensioning tools
2:15
designed to significantly accelerate the
2:18
entire documentation process for your
2:20
designs.
2:22
Considering manufacturing your design?
2:25
Discover how Fusion's integrated
2:27
manufacturing capabilities enable you to
2:30
generate tool paths directly linked to
2:33
your model.
2:35
Should the model be altered, the tool
2:37
paths will be updated.
2:39
Furthermore, you can simulate the
2:41
manufacturing process, confirming the
2:44
parts manufacturability before
2:46
committing to costly materials and
2:48
tools.
2:51
Finally, see how configurations can be
2:53
used to generate various design styles,
2:57
such as a left-handed or right-handed
2:59
fishing reel, or to modify attributes
3:02
like the spool size.
3:04
These changes will seamlessly update in
3:07
your existing drawings and manufacturing
3:09
tool paths, eliminating the need for
3:12
recreation or rework.
3:15
Please note that we can't cover every
3:17
Fusion command or feature in this
3:18
getting started series. To keep the
3:21
series manageable, the fishing reel
3:23
assembly used is a simplified version
3:26
with some parts removed or altered.
3:29
Hello, my name is Brad Talis and I look
3:32
forward to working with you on this
3:34
Autodesk Fusion getting started series.
3:37
It is designed to be informative,
3:39
instructive, and valuable.
3:41
This course offers a highle overview of
3:44
what Fusion can do for you from concept
3:47
to creation.
3:49
By the end of the series, you'll be
3:51
equipped with the knowledge and the
3:52
confidence to transform your next design
3:55
idea into reality.
