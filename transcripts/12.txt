In this video, the 12th in the getting
0:03
started series, we will learn about the
0:05
data panel and learn some additional
0:07
functionality such as team hubs,
0:11
projects,
0:12
public links, collaboration,
0:16
the home icon, and creating folders.
0:22
In Fusion, the data panel enables you to
0:24
view your projects and designs. You can
0:27
display or hide the data panel at any
0:29
time by clicking the data panel icon
0:32
next to the file menu.
0:35
At the top of the data panel, you'll
0:37
find the active team hub, which serves
0:40
as a central location for your team to
0:43
collaborate on designs and projects.
0:46
Think of a team hub as a highle
0:48
organizational name such as NASA.
0:52
Beneath this team hub, you'll find
0:54
various projects like the Mars rover
0:57
project or the Hubble telescope project.
1:01
Within each project, individual parts
1:04
and assemblies such as the wheel
1:06
assembly or an upper arm component are
1:09
stored.
1:11
Team hubs are particularly beneficial
1:13
for teams of designers who are working
1:16
on the same project or managing multiple
1:19
projects simultaneously.
1:21
refer to exhibit one.
1:25
The other option you have is the people
1:27
tab in the data panel. This is useful if
1:30
you want to invite certain people into
1:32
certain projects and not have them have
1:35
access to the whole team hub.
1:39
Clicking on the people tab allows you to
1:41
manage members in the project you are
1:43
currently in.
1:46
It will bring up a web browser and you
1:48
can enter in the email address of the
1:50
person or people that you want to add to
1:53
just that project.
1:56
Refer to exhibit 2.
1:59
If you want to just share a single
2:01
design with someone, you can create a
2:04
shared link.
2:06
This brings up a dialogue that creates a
2:08
custom link that you can copy and share
2:11
with your customer.
2:14
There are also options to allow them to
2:16
download the model in multiple different
2:18
formats and to also require an
2:20
additional password to be able to open
2:23
the link.
2:25
Refer to exhibit 3.
2:28
The sharable link offers a significant
2:31
advantage. Your customer doesn't need to
2:33
install any software to view the design
2:36
as it's entirely web browserbased.
2:40
This allows them to pan, zoom, and orbit
2:42
the model, take measurements, and even
2:45
add comments.
2:48
In Fusion, these markups are visible in
2:51
the comments section or in the web
2:54
details, which will be discussed later.
2:58
Refer to exhibit 4.
3:01
You can change some settings options in
3:03
the data panel by clicking on the gear
3:06
icon.
3:07
This menu allows you to sort the files
3:09
by alphabetical name or last updated.
3:15
You can also view the files in a list
3:17
mode or in a grid mode which shows
3:20
larger thumbnails of the models.
3:24
The open on web icon allows you to
3:27
access and manage your project data
3:29
efficiently within a web browser.
3:33
This centralized hub enables actions
3:35
such as selecting and managing multiple
3:38
files simultaneously,
3:40
including moving, copying, exporting, or
3:43
deleting them.
3:47
For instance, clicking on the fishing
3:49
reel assembly reveals all associated
3:52
design references.
3:55
Further investigation by clicking on the
3:58
spool shows its use in the fishing reel
4:01
assembly and displays customer comments
4:04
received via shared links.
4:08
A more detailed view of these markups
4:10
and comments can be accessed by clicking
4:13
the view and manage comments button.
4:17
Refer to exhibit 5.
4:22
Let's go back into Fusion and explore
4:24
the home icon.
4:27
This is a more graphical representation
4:29
of your files and gives you some
4:31
powerful search capabilities.
4:34
On the left, you will notice it's
4:36
currently displaying your recent
4:38
designs.
4:40
Click on the projects tab on the left,
4:42
then on default project under the
4:45
project section.
4:48
In the search field, type in wire and
4:51
press enter.
4:54
The results will show the original
4:56
fishing reel design we started with and
4:58
the fishing reel assembly we recently
5:01
created since both of them have a
5:03
component in them with the word wire in
5:06
their name.
5:08
Refer to exhibit six
5:13
to locate the spool. Clear the current
5:15
search and perform a new search for
5:18
spool.
5:21
Click the three dots next to the spool's
5:23
name and select show in location.
5:28
Fusion will then open the project
5:30
containing the spool.
5:34
Finally, click on the spool to open it
5:36
in a new tab.
5:39
Refer to exhibit 7.
5:42
You can also organize your project by
5:44
creating folders. In the data panel,
5:48
click on new folder and name it handle
5:51
parts.
5:54
Right click on the handle start file and
5:57
select move.
5:59
Select the handle parts folder from the
6:02
dialogue and then click on the move
6:04
button.
6:07
Repeat this process for the handle grip
6:09
file.
6:18
Create another folder and name it bail
6:20
parts.
6:22
This time hold down your control key and
6:25
select the bail arms, spool, bail, and
6:30
tensioner.
6:32
Then right click and select move.
6:36
Choose the bail parts folder and
6:38
complete the move.
6:41
All of the files will move into the
6:43
folder at the same time.
6:46
It is a good idea to keep your projects
6:48
as organized as possible to help
6:50
simplify your design process.
6:54
Refer to exhibit 8.
6:57
In the next video, we will learn about
6:59
inspecting our design.
