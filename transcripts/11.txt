In this video, the 11th in the getting
0:03
started series, we will learn how to
0:05
assemble our components together and
0:07
learn some additional functionality such
0:10
as joint command, asbuilt joints, rigid
0:15
groups,
0:16
constrain components,
0:19
motion links, and insert fasteners.
0:24
Now that we've created a majority of the
0:26
models in the design, we want to start
0:28
assembling them together.
0:31
Start by expanding open the data panel
0:33
and opening the fishing reel assembly.
0:38
With the data panel still open, right
0:40
click on the spool in the data panel and
0:43
select insert into current design.
0:48
The spool will appear at the bottom of
0:50
the fishing reel. So, drag one of the
0:52
translation arrows to move the spool off
0:55
to the side and press okay.
0:59
Refer to exhibit one.
1:02
We want to move the spool to a very
1:04
specific position. So, we will use the
1:07
joint command to accomplish this.
1:10
From the assemble menu, select joint.
1:15
Zoom up on the top of the spool and
1:18
hover near the slot.
1:21
You will see many tick marks signifying
1:24
center points, midpoints, and end
1:27
points.
1:29
Trying to pick the correct one can be
1:31
challenging as you move your mouse.
1:34
Here's a neat tip. Hold down the control
1:37
or command key to control your
1:39
selection, and it will only allow you to
1:42
pick the tick marks on the face when you
1:44
held down the control key.
1:48
Click on the center point in the middle
1:50
of the slot.
1:52
Refer to exhibit two.
1:56
Zoom out. Then zoom in on the bottom
1:59
threaded area of the shaft.
2:02
Hover over the flat face at the bottom
2:05
of the threads.
2:07
A tick mark will appear at the center of
2:10
the shaft.
2:12
Hold down the control key and select the
2:14
center mark.
2:16
Refer to exhibit three.
2:20
The spool will move from the original
2:22
location to this new location.
2:25
It may end up flipped in orientation.
2:29
If so, just click the flip option in the
2:32
joint dialogue.
2:35
Click on the motion tab in the dialogue
2:37
to confirm that the motion type is set
2:39
to rigid.
2:42
The top center of the slot on the spool
2:44
is now rigidly connected with the center
2:47
of the flat face of the shaft.
2:50
If we rotate the bail, you will notice
2:53
that the spool and the shaft rotate
2:55
together because they are rigidly
2:57
connected.
2:59
However, you will also notice that the
3:01
bail wire is not rotating with the
3:03
assembly as we would like.
3:07
With the bail wire in its current
3:09
position, we can utilize the asbuilt
3:11
joint tool.
3:14
This tool found in the assemble menu
3:17
allows us to define a joint type without
3:19
the need to reference tick marks.
3:23
Select asbuilt joint. Then choose both
3:26
the bail wire and the small black bale
3:29
arm.
3:31
Ensure that the motion type is set to
3:33
rigid and then click okay.
3:37
Now when the bail rotates, the bail wire
3:40
will move in conjunction with it thanks
3:43
to the rigid asbuilt joint.
3:47
You will notice a chain link icon next
3:50
to the spool and some other components
3:52
in the browser indicating that they are
3:54
referenced designs.
3:57
This means that you can't directly
3:58
modify them, for example, by adding a
4:01
fillet or a chamfer. To make changes,
4:04
you'd typically open the original model,
4:07
make and save your edits, and then the
4:10
update would reflect in this design.
4:13
Alternatively, Fusion offers an edit in
4:16
place feature, allowing you to make
4:18
changes directly within this design, and
4:21
saving it will also update the original
4:24
spool design.
4:26
Access the data panel and insert the
4:28
handle start subasssembly.
4:32
Observe that currently there are no
4:34
joint relationships between the
4:36
components when attempting to drag them.
4:40
To connect the handle and the shaft, use
4:42
the rigid group feature from the
4:44
assemble menu.
4:46
Select both the handle and the shaft,
4:49
but do not include the end cap at this
4:51
time.
4:53
Now, moving the handle will also move
4:56
the shaft.
4:59
To position the handle, we will use the
5:01
joint command again.
5:04
This time, use the J shortcut key to run
5:08
the joint command.
5:10
Select the outside circular edge of the
5:12
handle and then the circular edge on the
5:16
reel.
5:17
You may need to flip the alignment.
5:21
Set the motion type to revolute.
5:25
Refer to exhibit 4.
5:31
The constrain components command is
5:33
ideal for keeping the hexagon face of
5:35
the end cap aligned with the hex shaft.
5:40
To do this, go to the assemble menu and
5:42
select constrain components.
5:46
Then select the top inside face of the
5:49
hex hole in the end cap and the top face
5:53
of the hex shaft.
5:55
This action will ensure that these two
5:58
faces remain planer.
6:01
Refer to exhibit 5.
6:04
Next, click the plus symbol in the
6:06
dialogue to add another constraint.
6:11
Select the circular edge of the end cap
6:14
and the circular edge of the reel where
6:16
the end cap would sit.
6:19
This creates a revolute relationship
6:21
between these two edges.
6:24
Refer to exhibit six.
6:27
Rotate the endcap and notice that the
6:29
handle rotates also as it's connected to
6:31
the shaft that the end cap now has a
6:34
relationship with.
6:36
We want the bail to rotate when we crank
6:38
the handle. So, we can link the two
6:40
together with a motion link. In the
6:43
assemble menu, select motion link and
6:47
then select the revolute joint on the
6:49
handle and then the revolute joint on
6:52
the bail.
6:54
The preview will show the two joints
6:56
linked together.
6:59
We want the bail to rotate clockwise as
7:02
we rotate the handle clockwise.
7:04
So, click the reverse option in the
7:06
dialogue and press okay.
7:10
Now, crank the handle in the viewport
7:12
and notice the movement on the screen.
7:19
We can also change the gear ratio of the
7:21
spool by editing the motion link.
7:25
Right click on the motion link in the
7:26
timeline and select edit feature.
7:31
Change the angle of the first angle
7:33
dialogue to 90.
7:36
This means that for every 90° we turn
7:39
the handle, the bail will turn 360°.
7:44
Press okay and crank the handle and
7:47
notice the difference in rotational
7:49
speed.
7:56
Insert the handle grip into the design
7:58
and drag it off to the side.
8:02
Create a revolute joint between the
8:04
circular edge of the handle grip and the
8:07
circular edge of the handle.
8:16
To hold the handle grip in place, we
8:18
need to insert a fastener.
8:21
From the insert menu, select insert
8:24
fastener.
8:27
From the standard pull down, scroll down
8:30
and select metric under the unit system.
8:34
This will filter out all of the other
8:36
fasteners and only show the metric
8:38
fasteners.
8:41
Then click on bolts and screws,
8:44
then round washer head.
8:48
The dialogue will now show all of the
8:51
metric round washer head screws that are
8:53
available.
8:56
Let's filter our selection even more and
8:58
select just the ISO standard from the
9:00
pull down.
9:02
Now only the metric ISO round washer
9:05
head screw is displayed.
9:08
Click on it to select it.
9:11
Refer to exhibit 7.
9:14
Hover over the hole in the handle and
9:17
the appropriate fastener size will
9:19
automatically be selected.
9:22
Click to place the fastener. Then set
9:25
the nominal length to 16 and click okay.
9:30
Observe how the fastener automatically
9:32
creates a rigid joint when you rotate
9:35
the handle.
9:39
The last part is to assemble the
9:41
tensioner at the top.
9:44
Upload the tensioner file from the
9:46
exhibits into the project and then
9:49
insert it into the design.
10:05
Drag the tensioner up above the whole
10:08
assembly and press okay.
10:12
Again, we want to line up the flat faces
10:15
of the screw shaft with the tensioner.
10:18
So, we will use the constrain components
10:20
one more time.
10:22
Select the side flat face of the screw
10:25
hole on the tensioner
10:28
and then the side flat face of the
10:30
shaft.
10:32
Press okay and drag the tensioner up
10:34
further if needed.
10:37
Edit the constrain components feature in
10:39
the timeline and add another constraint.
10:43
Select the inside bottom of the screw
10:46
hole on the tensioner
10:48
and then the top face of the shaft.
10:52
The tensioner will snap down into place.
10:55
However, it is not yet centered.
10:59
Add a final constraint and select the
11:02
outside cylindrical face of the
11:04
tensioner and the inside cylindrical
11:06
face of the spool.
11:09
Press okay and then rotate the handle.
11:14
The tensioner will rotate with the
11:15
spool.
11:18
If you want to toggle the visibility of
11:20
the joints on or off, you can select the
11:23
display settings icon and then object
11:27
visibility
11:28
joints.
11:31
Now when we rotate the joints icons do
11:34
not display.
11:39
Go to the file menu and select save as
11:43
and type in fishing reel assembly to
11:46
save this as a new file.
11:52
In the next video, we will cover the
11:54
data panel and collaboration.
