This video, the second in the getting
0:02
started series, will guide you through
0:04
the Fusion interface. Topics covered
0:07
include the user interface, setting
0:10
units, changing preferences, and using
0:13
pan, zoom, and orbit functionalities.
0:17
The Fusion interface features workspaces
0:19
in the upper left corner which divide
0:22
its functionality into areas like
0:24
design, simulation, manufacture,
0:28
drawings, and electronics.
0:32
This organization simplifies the user
0:34
experience
0:36
within each workspace. Further
0:38
subdivision exists at the top through
0:41
sub menus such as solid, surface, mesh,
0:45
sheet metal, and others.
0:49
The data panel is also located in this
0:51
area. It allows you to view your
0:54
projects and manage the viewing and
0:55
loading of your designs.
0:58
The data panel will be discussed in a
1:00
future video in this series.
1:03
The primary toolbar contains main menus
1:06
such as create, modify, assemble,
1:10
configure, and inspect to name a few.
1:16
Each main menu displays its available
1:18
commands.
1:20
Observe that some commands have
1:22
corresponding keyboard shortcuts
1:25
such as E for extrude and H for h whole.
1:29
Additionally, certain commands feature
1:32
flyyou sub menus like pattern.
1:37
The structure browser located on the
1:39
left displays and organizes your
1:42
assemblies components and parts.
1:45
Here you can toggle the visibility of
1:47
parts,
1:49
activate components, and rearrange the
1:52
assembly structure.
1:55
Expanding the document settings flyyou
1:58
as indicated by the gear icon allows you
2:01
to configure the length and mass
2:03
property units for the current design.
2:06
The timeline located at the bottom of
2:09
the screen displays the features or the
2:11
steps used to construct each component.
2:15
It allows you to revisit and modify your
2:17
design features such as sketch
2:20
dimensions, shell thicknesses, and
2:23
fillet radiuses.
2:24
You can think of it like a step-by-step
2:27
recipe of how the part was designed.
2:30
The main viewport displays a 3D
2:32
representation of your design, whether
2:34
it's a single part or a complete
2:37
assembly.
2:38
Let's create a simple box to learn how
2:40
to navigate the viewport.
2:44
Go to the create menu and then select
2:47
box.
2:49
Select an orange plane to specify the
2:51
drawing surface. Then click to define
2:54
the first corner and again to define the
2:57
opposite corner of the box.
3:01
Confirm by clicking okay in the box
3:03
dialogue.
3:06
To pan, hold down the middle mouse
3:08
button and move the mouse.
3:12
To zoom, scroll the middle mouse wheel
3:15
away from you to zoom out or toward you
3:18
to zoom in.
3:21
Notice that zooming is centered on the
3:23
mouse cursor's position.
3:28
And to orbit, hold down the shift key
3:31
and the middle mouse button to rotate
3:33
the model and view it from different
3:35
angles.
3:39
You can also orbit the view by dragging
3:41
the cube located in the viewports upper
3:44
right corner.
3:46
Clicking different faces of this cube
3:48
allows you to view your design from the
3:50
top, the front, side, or an isometric
3:54
view.
3:58
Select the home icon to restore the view
4:01
and fit your design back into the
4:03
screen.
4:04
At the bottom of the viewport are the
4:07
settings icons where you can set visual
4:09
styles such as shaded or wireframe.
4:16
You can also change the environment
4:18
background to set different background
4:20
themes.
4:23
The graphics effects menu allows you to
4:26
show things such as shadows,
4:28
anti-aliasing, or reflections.
4:32
By turning some of these on or off, it
4:34
can affect the performance of your
4:36
machine.
4:38
Object visibility allows you to toggle
4:41
what work features are displayed in the
4:43
viewport.
4:46
In the camera settings, it's best to
4:49
choose the perspective with ortho faces
4:52
option.
4:53
This setting provides the most realistic
4:55
3D view of your design.
4:58
Additionally, it automatically switches
5:00
to an orthographic view when you're
5:02
looking directly at one of the planer
5:04
faces of the cube, such as front or top.
5:09
The preference menu can be accessed by
5:12
clicking on your avatar or initials in
5:14
the upper right corner of Fusion.
5:18
This menu is organized into several
5:20
sections on the left and allows you to
5:22
customize various settings, including
5:25
default modeling orientation and
5:28
automatic save on close.
5:33
Under the design section, there are many
5:35
options you might find useful. One being
5:38
scale entire sketch at first dimension.
5:43
More information about each setting can
5:45
be found by hovering over it and reading
5:48
the tool tip.
5:51
You can also set what the default units
5:53
for all designs should be.
5:56
Now that you're familiar with the user
5:58
interface, the next video will explain
6:00
how to begin sketching in Fusion.
