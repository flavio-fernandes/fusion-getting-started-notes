In this video, the 16th in the getting
0:02
started series, we will learn about
0:05
configurations and learn some additional
0:07
functionality such as adding aspects,
0:12
parameters,
0:13
appearance themes, and associivity.
0:18
Fusion enables the creation of
0:21
configurable designs, offering control
0:23
over parameters and features through a
0:26
table.
0:27
This functionality is incredibly
0:29
powerful for generating design
0:31
variations without the need for
0:33
individual remodeling.
0:37
If continuing from the last
0:38
manufacturing video, switch from the
0:41
manufacturing workspace to the design
0:43
workspace with the spool design.
0:47
Edit the first sketch in the timeline.
0:51
To make things easier to understand in
0:54
the configuration table, we are going to
0:56
name some of the dimensions in the
0:58
sketch.
1:00
Double click on the 37.5 diameter
1:03
dimension and type in OD equals 37.5.
1:11
Then double click on the 24 diameter
1:14
dimension and type in ID= 24.
1:20
Then click on finish sketch.
1:23
In the configure menu, click on the
1:26
configure icon.
1:29
This puts us into the configuration mode
1:32
and brings up the configuration table.
1:35
You will notice items in the timeline
1:38
are highlighted blue. These are all the
1:40
items that can be configured.
1:43
In the configuration table, click on the
1:46
add parameters or the FX button.
1:52
This will bring up the parameters table
1:54
where you can expand open the sketch one
1:57
under spool.
1:59
In the table you will see the OD and ID
2:02
parameters along with many other
2:05
dimensions.
2:07
Now you can see why we named them
2:08
earlier.
2:10
Click the check boxes next to OD and ID
2:13
in the parameters table and they will
2:16
get added to the configuration table.
2:20
Then press okay in the parameters table.
2:24
Refer to exhibit one.
2:26
Next, click on the whole feature in the
2:29
timeline.
2:31
A whole configuration dialogue will
2:33
appear.
2:35
Click on suppression and diameter in the
2:38
dialogue.
2:40
This will allow us to either turn the
2:42
holes on or off in the design or to
2:45
change their diameter.
2:48
Press okay and then click on the pattern
2:51
feature in the timeline and select the
2:54
quantity option and press okay.
3:00
Notice how the table is being built out
3:02
with all of the options we have
3:04
selected.
3:06
The whole diameter column can easily be
3:08
renamed by right-clicking on the column
3:11
and selecting rename column.
3:15
Change the name to whole diameter.
3:20
We can also rename the configuration to
3:23
original by right-clicking on the
3:26
configuration name and selecting rename.
3:31
Refer to exhibit two.
3:34
To add another configuration, click the
3:38
plus symbol.
3:41
All information will be copied into the
3:43
new configuration, and the blue bar next
3:46
to configuration 2 will indicate that
3:48
it's active.
3:51
Any changes made in the table will be
3:53
reflected in the 3D model.
3:57
In the table, change the OD to 38 and
4:02
the ID to 20.
4:06
Change the whole diameter to four
4:09
and the whole quantity to 18.
4:14
Notice how the 3D model updated with all
4:16
of these changes automatically.
4:20
Rename this configuration to light.
4:26
We can toggle between the two
4:28
configurations by doubleclicking on
4:30
their name in the configuration table.
4:34
To configure different materials for
4:36
appearance or mass properties,
4:39
right click on the top level spool in
4:41
the browser and select configure.
4:46
In the dialogue that appears, click on
4:49
physical material.
4:52
A physical material theme will be added
4:54
to the configuration table.
4:59
Rename theme one to aluminum and then
5:03
close the configuration table.
5:07
Refer to exhibit 3.
5:11
From the modify menu, select physical
5:15
material
5:17
and in the search field, enter steel.
5:22
In the results, scroll down until you
5:25
see steel.
5:27
Then drag steel onto the spool and close
5:31
the physical material dialogue.
5:36
Bring the configuration table back up
5:38
and click on the aluminum pulld down.
5:41
And notice steel is now part of the
5:43
list.
5:45
Click the plus icon to add a physical
5:48
material theme.
5:52
Rename the theme to steel and change the
5:56
pull down to steel.
5:59
Notice in the configuration table there
6:02
is now a physical material column.
6:06
Select the steel theme for the original
6:08
configuration and leave aluminum for the
6:11
light configuration.
6:14
Then close the table.
6:17
Refer to exhibit 4.
6:20
You can also select which configuration
6:22
you want by choosing the configuration
6:25
from the browser on the left.
6:28
Currently, we are looking at the
6:30
original configuration.
6:33
If we do a mass properties of the top
6:35
level, we can see that the material is
6:39
steel and that the mass is 90 g.
6:46
If we change the configuration to light
6:49
and do the mass properties again,
6:52
this time it shows the material as
6:54
aluminum and the mass is only 26 g.
7:01
Let's go ahead and save the spool.
7:04
You will notice a warning appears saying
7:07
that the spool will be saved as a
7:09
configured design.
7:11
Go ahead and press okay.
7:17
Open the fishing reel assembly from the
7:19
data panel.
7:22
After opening, it will notify you that
7:24
the spool is out of date.
7:29
Click on the update icon in the main
7:31
menu.
7:34
The spool in the browser is now called
7:36
original as that was the name of the
7:38
configuration and it is displaying the
7:41
original configuration in this fishing
7:43
reel assembly.
7:46
Right click on original in the browser
7:49
and select switch configuration
7:52
and it allows you to select which
7:54
configuration you want as part of the
7:57
assembly.
7:59
Select light from the configuration
8:01
dialogue and press okay.
8:05
Refer to exhibit 5.
8:09
You can also use configurations to show
8:12
different design styles. For example, we
8:15
want to show a left-handed and a
8:17
right-handed style of this fishing reel
8:20
assembly.
8:22
Start by creating a new component called
8:25
handle assembly
8:28
and drag the handle start handle grip
8:32
and fastener into that assembly.
8:39
Activate the top level assembly and then
8:42
right click on the handle assembly and
8:44
select move copy.
8:48
Click on the create copy checkbox in the
8:51
dialogue. Then move and rotate the
8:54
copied assembly to the other side of the
8:56
fishing reel and press okay.
9:00
Refer to exhibit six.
9:05
Turn off the first handle assembly.
9:10
Using rigid group, group the handle and
9:13
the end cap together.
9:18
Then use the joint command to create a
9:21
revolute joint between the handle and
9:24
the reel.
9:32
Now turn off the second handle assembly
9:34
and turn on the first.
9:38
Right click on the first handle assembly
9:40
and select configure.
9:44
Check the visibility option and press
9:46
okay.
9:49
Then right click on the second handle
9:52
assembly and select configure and check
9:55
its visibility option on. Also
10:02
start by renaming configuration one to
10:06
right-handed in the configuration table.
10:10
Next, add a new configuration using the
10:13
plus icon and label it left-handed.
10:18
For this left-handed setup, deactivate
10:22
the first handle assembly and activate
10:24
the second.
10:26
Finally, close the configuration table.
10:31
refer to exhibit 7
10:38
in the browser. Make sure that the
10:40
configuration is set to left-handed and
10:42
then save the assembly.
10:45
The warning message will appear again
10:47
notifying you that the assembly will be
10:49
saved as a configured assembly.
10:53
Switch back to the spool design by
10:55
clicking on the spool tab. We can see
10:58
that the configuration is the light
11:00
configuration that has the larger holes
11:03
and hole quantity and smaller spool
11:06
inner diameter.
11:09
Change from the design to the
11:10
manufacturer workspace.
11:14
Our setup with all of our tool paths are
11:16
listed, but they are all out of date due
11:18
to the changes made to the model.
11:21
Right click on setup and choose
11:24
generate.
11:27
All of the tool paths will regenerate.
11:31
The only change we need to make is to
11:33
change the drill from a 3mm drill to a
11:36
4mm drill.
11:48
Also notice because we referenced the
11:51
hole quantity parameter in the drill
11:53
pattern, the drill pattern is now
11:56
drilling 18 holes instead of 12.
12:00
Refer to exhibit 8.
12:04
Lastly, open the fishing reel assembly
12:07
drawing.
12:09
Notice in the drawing browser the top
12:11
level assembly is labeled right-handed
12:14
as that is what the first configuration
12:16
in the configuration table is.
12:19
Right click on right-handed and select
12:22
switch configuration
12:24
and it will allow you to change the
12:26
current sheet to the left-handed
12:29
configuration.
12:31
Notice the view updates and even the
12:33
parts table updates depending on what is
12:36
visible in the view.
12:39
Clicking on the second sheet in the
12:41
drawing set shows the top, front, right,
12:44
and isometric views of the whole
12:46
assembly.
12:47
Again, we can choose to have this sheet
12:50
display the left-handed configuration,
12:52
and the views will update.
12:55
Some of the existing dimensions get
12:57
removed as they were associated with
13:00
geometry that is no longer visible. So,
13:03
rerun the automatic dimension command to
13:06
recreate the missing overall dimensions.
13:11
And that brings us to the end of the
13:13
Autodesk Fusion getting started series.
13:16
Over the course of this journey, you've
13:18
gone from the fundamentals like creating
13:20
fully constrained sketches, building and
13:23
editing models, and working with a
13:25
timeline to tackling more advanced
13:28
challenges.
13:30
You designed a bale component,
13:33
explored constraints and extrude to
13:35
object, and even learned how to bring in
13:38
external models, position them, and
13:41
modify them with direct editing.
13:44
From there, you leveled up with powerful
13:47
tools like sweep, loft, and form, giving
13:51
you the ability to create complex
13:53
organic shapes like those in the fishing
13:56
reel assembly.
13:58
You assembled parts, inspected them for
14:01
issues, and generated professional
14:03
drawing sets, even tapping into Fusion's
14:07
built-in AI features to speed things up.
14:11
Then came the manufacturing workspace
14:14
where you added tool paths, simulated
14:16
machining, and saw how Fusion helps you
14:19
validate your design before cutting your
14:22
part.
14:23
And finally, you unlock the power of
14:25
configurations,
14:27
giving you the flexibility to explore
14:29
design variations and make latest stage
14:32
changes.
14:34
Knowing your drawings and tool paths
14:36
will update automatically.
14:38
But this is just the beginning. There's
14:40
a whole world of Fusion resources
14:42
waiting for you. Whether it's the
14:44
self-paced learning right inside of
14:46
Fusion or the active community on
14:49
YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, and more.
14:54
I hope that this series has left you
14:56
feeling confident, inspired, and ready
14:58
to take your designs further than ever
15:01
before. Now it's your turn. Go create,
15:04
explore, and see what Fusion can do for
15:07
you.
